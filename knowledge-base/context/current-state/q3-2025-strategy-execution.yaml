  ## Three-Part Q3 Strategy
  
  ### 1. Go DEEP on Trust (Enterprise & Mid-Market)
  **Target Impact**: +15-20K reviews/month
  
  **Key Initiatives**:
  - Launch Compliance Trust Bundle (GDPR brief + model-governance paper + SOC 2)
  - ACAMS Las Vegas Innovation Session + booth (Sept 16-18)
  - Publish 3 case studies: Coinbase (anonymised), IG bake-off win, Airwallex ramp
  - End free pilots: require $10K pilot fee or Agent Hub sandbox usage
  - Launch in-product chat for Compliance transparency
  
  **Rationale**: Compliance teams are risk-averse, lack urgency, and demand high trust early. We've been engaging them too late in the sales cycle.
  
  ### 2. Go BROAD with Agent Hub (PLG)
  **Target Impact**: +5K reviews/month from 50 activated signups (floor: 40 signups → 4K reviews)
  
  **4 Experiments** (launching weekly):
  1. Vendor Due Diligence (Aug 12)
  2. Real-Estate AML (Aug 19)
  3. Investment Adviser Screening (Aug 26)
  4. Marketplace Trust & Safety (Sep 2)
  
  **Success Gate**: ≥ 5 signups in 30 days per experiment
  **Outbound**: 500-1,000 enriched leads via Clay across all tests
  
  ### 3. Cut Burn & Extend Runway
  **Target**: Reduce burn from $250K → $175K/month
  
  **Actions**:
  - No backfill for $175K engineer role (saves $16K/mo)
  - Cut founder salaries 25% (saves $10K/mo)  
  - Migrate infra to Northflank - 50% COGS reduction (saves $32.5K/mo)
  - Reallocate Head-of-Revenue budget to content, Clay, events (saves $14.6K/mo)
  
  **Result**: Runway extends from 12 months → 15 months
  
  ## Budget Reallocation (Monthly)
  - Content + case studies: $4.5K
  - LinkedIn + fintech newsletters: $5.0K
  - Clay GTM agency: $7.5K
  - Events (ACAMS + podcasts): $6.0K
  - **Total GTM spend**: $23K (fully offset by Head-of-Revenue savings)
  
  ## Success Metrics by Sept 30
  - Monthly reviews: ≥ 50K (floor: 40K)
  - Paid pilots: ≥ 2
  - Agent Hub signups: 50 (floor: 40)
  - Trust Bundle downloads: ≥ 50
  - Burn rate: ≤ $175K/month
  - Burn multiple: ≤ 2.0×
