Monthly Investor Updates

May 2025
Subject: Parcha Investor Update March 2025
Parcha Investors,
It‚Äôs been a busy couple of months at Parcha. We completed the MVP of our new self-serve onboarding flow
which we demo‚Äôd at Finovate last week to lots of positive feedback. We also finally ramped up production
jobs with Coinbase and at signing stage of a $1.5M expansion (delayed due to recent Coinbase data breach
news). Anu Gardiner also joined our team as our first GTM hire, organizing a sold-out dinner at Finovate in
her first 3 weeks and is now focused on enterprise fintech sales.
Finally a huge thank you to Initialized, Kindred and Fin Cap for investing an additional $2M in Parcha ahead
raising our series A.
Moving forwards we will be sending these updates every ~8 weeks in line with our board meetings.
Reminder: What Parcha does
Parcha accelerates compliance with AI agents ‚Äî handling due diligence, AML screening, and document
verification. Fintechs and banks use our platform to reduce onboarding time and boost operational
efficiency without increasing risk. Our platform supports:
1. Automated document validation: This is a big painpoint for B2B fintechs when onboarding businesses as
documents vary by jurisdiction and KYB processes. No existing vendors solve this well.
2. Business and individual due diligence: B2B fintechs need to carry out extensive due diligence on their
customers including understanding what type of products the business sells, what industry it operates
in, who the business owners are, what their online presence is and much more. B2C fintechs use our
due diligence to determine source of funds, criminal background and geographical locations of
customers as part of financial crime investigations. This is all done very manually today.
3. AML Screening: Over 90% of alerts from adverse media, sanctions, watchlist and PEP screening are
false positive. This creates a massive review overhead for fintechs both during onboarding at when
monitoring transactions. Parcha‚Äôs AI reduces false positives by 90%, speeding up the screening up the
screening process of individuals and businesses.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked + realized): ~$910,000
‚ó¶ Monthly Reviews (last 30 days): ~30K
‚ó¶ Enterprise Pipeline: Worldpay, Moneygram, IG Group, Monza, JPMC, Uber, Moonpay, Dwolla, Nova
‚Ä¢ Cash: $3,540,368
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate: ~$278K (Infra costs up as we ramp up Coinnbase, +1 new hire)
‚Ä¢ Runway: ~13 month
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Ramped up ARR: With Coinbase finally in production and Airwallex scaling their us of Parcha ARR is
ramping up. We expect to hit ~$500K in ARR by end of this month with ~$1.5M in contracted ARR yet to
ramp.

‚Ä¢ Parcha 2.0 progress: We demo‚Äôed the MVP of our new agent builder flow ‚ÄúParcha 2.0‚Äù at Finovate and
got lots of positive feedback, generating almost 60 leads. We‚Äôre now putting the finishing touches on
the flow, including end-to-end self-serve onboarding with Stripe integration, support for KYC agents in
addition to KYB agents and a new agent dashboard. Our goal is to launch in early June.
‚Ä¢ First sales hire: We hired Anu Gardiner as our first sales hire via referral from Initialized (thank you!).
This comes with decades of experience in B2B sales but the ability to also role her sleeves up and
execute. In her first 3 weeks she hustled to organize a sold-out dinner at the Finovate conference
attended by JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Academy bank and Lending Club among others by texting
attendees. She‚Äôs now focused on cleaning up our funnel, supporting a few large pilots including IG
Group, Worldpay and Flagstone and developing more leads across fintech and banking.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Talent Challenges: Our founding designer John Baunach is leaving Parcha for family reasons post-
Parcha 2.0 launch. We‚Äôre look for a new AI-first designer with PLG/Prosumer SaaS experience. We also
had to let go on recently hired AI engineer 3 weeks in due to being a poor cultural fit. We‚Äôre going to
update our values interview to include more behavioral questions to avoid this happening again.
‚Ä¢ Competitive Landscape & Strategic Response: Greenlite is becoming a significant competitor - we‚Äôre
seeing them come up in a lot more deals than last year. We‚Äôre focused on launching our self-serve
product so we accelerate time to value/revenue/integration and gain momentum.
‚Ä¢ Burn Rate: April's burn rate increased to ~$278K due to higher headcount and infrastructure costs. Our
expected target net burn is ~$250K over the next few months as we increase ARR but also ramp up
GTM efforts.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update March 2025
Parcha Investors,
We‚Äôre going to keep this one short. Our biggest challenge over the last few months is that our pipeline
across outbound, pilots, and closing contracts is moving too slowly. Over the next couple of months, we‚Äôre
going to be laser-focused on speeding this up with multiple GTM / product experiments to fuel more demos,
accelerate pilots, and close contracts faster. On the positive side, we are closing on a seven-figure
expansion with Coinbase, and we‚Äôre finalizing negotiations with their procurement team.
We will be heads down to focus on this and will send our next investor update in May.
Reminder: What Parcha does
We‚Äôre building an AI-powered compliance suite for fintechs and banks to accelerate their KYB/KYC manual
compliance reviews. Today there are three main use cases we are focused on:
1. Automated document validation: This is a big painpoint for B2B fintechs when onboarding businesses as
documents vary by jurisdiction and KYB processes. No existing vendors solve this well.
2. Business due diligence: B2B fintechs need to carry out extensive due diligence on their customers

3. Customer introductions: We're looking to connect with more B2B Fintech companies experiencing
strong growth that are bottlenecked by KYB or KYC reviews. The ideal contact for onboarding is the
product or business owner, not the head of compliance.
Founding AE
‚Ä¢ 5-7 yrs experience with 0-1 enterprise sales via outbound motion (not PLG), ideally with experience
selling to fintechs and banks. Needs to be super resourceful and comfortable with ambiguity. The ideal
candidate is excited to build out sales processes, not just crush quota.
For both roles:

‚Ä¢ Startup experience. Ideally, previous experience as a founding engineer or early hire at a startup.
‚Ä¢ Based in SF and excited to work in our office 5 days a week.

üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked + realized): ~$828,995
‚ó¶ Monthly Reviews: 5K (Down 90% because Coinbase completed bulk backlog and we haven‚Äôt
ramped up production traffic yet. We expect this to increase in April)
‚ó¶ Q1 Pilots: ~$800K Forecasted (Flex, Mercury, Worldpay, Paxos, LiveOak, FIS Capital Markets,
Prelim, Synctera)
‚ó¶ Pilot interest in pipeline: ~$700K+ Forecasted (Prelim (channel partner), Popular, US Bank,
Synctera)
‚ó¶ Enterprise Pipeline: Worldpay, AmEx, Block, US Bank, Monza, AffinityPay, JPMC, Uber, Moonpay
‚Ä¢ Cash: $2,098,285
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate: ~$250K (Lots of one-off payments for SOC2, annual SaaS contracts, moving our FE eng
to San Francisco)
‚Ä¢ Runway: ~12 month
Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Coinbase Expansion Progress: We're in the final procurement stages of negotiating a seven-figure
expansion with Coinbase, which will be a significant milestone toward increasing our ARR. Coinbase is
finally doing its model evaluations, which is the last step toward going to production with them. This has
been a complicated process full of learnings regarding model governance and enterprise customers.
‚Ä¢ Production Implementations and Pilot Progress: Airwallex is now running production cases as part of
their pilot testing, and Pipe's integration with Alloy is starting this week. Some of our bigger pilots are
moving along - Paxos finished their integration and will be starting to send documents shortly, Worldpay
is evaluating test cases in our platform, and we're making steady progress with several enterprise
customers despite integration challenges.
‚Ä¢ We finally closed our open role as an applied AI engineer. We just closed Chris, who will join us from
ML/Tech Lead at Meta, Prev. Salesforce, Chartboost. Chris brings experience with traditional ML and
Gen AI at scale. In Meta, he led projects reducing operational overhead for ad operations teams while
avoiding revenue losses. https://www.linkedin.com/in/krzysztofsuchanek/
Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Pipeline Velocity Issues: Our biggest challenge is that our pipeline across outbound, pilots, and closing
contracts is moving too slowly, leading to multiple "in progress" or "missed" goals.

‚Ä¢ Pilot Integration timelines: It's taking multiple months for pilot customers to fully integrate before
testing begins, creating significant delays in our sales cycle and revenue recognition.
Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing to accelerate Parcha:
‚ó¶ We‚Äôre going to make it really easy to upload CSV files and start evaluating Parcha without any eng
integration. The majority of our revenue from last work was from batch file uploads and we want to
make this a core use case
‚ó¶ We‚Äôre adding more synthetic data to enable customers start testing our Parcha without needing to
use their own data.
‚ó¶ We‚Äôre making agent configuration and setup more self serve.
‚Ä¢ Resource Constraints: We are still resource-constrained in the engineering team. Our backend
engineering has a bus factor of one (Miguel), which is not ideal and is leading to tough prioritization
decisions week over week. GTM is also limited by AJ‚Äôs bandwidth vs. product and expansions, so we're
seeking a founding AE who can focus on sales 100%. Please see the Asks section below and help us
hire a fantastic backend/systems engineer with Python experience who can help us scale and mature.
‚Ä¢ Burn was high due to one-off costs: Net burn was higher last month as we had several outstanding
annual contracts plus moving our only remote engineer from NYC to SF to be in person. This was
coupled with revenue going down as Coinbase completed their large remediation job ahead of a full
production rollout which we expect to start in April.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update February 2025
Parcha Investors,
We have multiple pilots up and running this quarter with Paxos, Worldpay, Mercury, Flex.one and FIS Capital
Markets. We‚Äôre getting closer to our $1M ARR goal but are still finalizing the expanded contract with
Coinbase.
Reminder: What Parcha does
We‚Äôre building an AI-powered compliance suite for fintechs and banks to accelerate their KYB/KYC manual
compliance reviews. Today there are three main use cases we are focused on:
1. Automated document validation: This is a big painpoint for B2B fintechs when onboarding businesses as

We are ramping up a search for both a backend engineer and an Applied AI engineer with Python
experience. Their ideal profile is:
Applied AI Engineer:
‚Ä¢ Deep expertise in modern LLMs and their applications, ideally using them in production at scale.
Experience with LLM backtesting and a strong foundation in ML evaluation and testing.

üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (contracted + realized): ~$810,000
‚ó¶ Monthly Reviews: 51K
‚ó¶ Q1 Pilots: ~$800K Forecasted (Flex, Mercury, Worldpay, Paxos, LiveOak, FIS Capital Markets,
Prelim)
‚Ä¢ Cash: $2,251,354
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$179K / ~13 months
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Scaled Coinbase to 60K reviews in December: The team pulled off an incredible feat scaling from
~1,000 reviews/month to over 60,000 reviews in December to help Coinbase clear their transaction alert
backlog. This required building multiple new features including batch processing, CSV downloads, batch
PDF exports, and significant infrastructure improvements. The team worked around the clock to support
this 50X scale increase.
‚Ä¢ Closed Airwallex as strategic customer: After a successful quarter-long POC focused on real-time
document verification, we closed Airwallex with an initial $15K contract. While the initial contract is
modest, this is a strategic win given their brand recognition and significant expansion potential as we
become an established vendor.
‚Ä¢ Strong Q1 pilot pipeline: We've secured pilots with several significant players including WorldPay,
Paxos, Flex, Skyline, Prelim, Mercury, LiveOak and notably 3 banks including Valley Bank ($60B+ in
assets). These represent over $500K in potential value and importantly validate our expansion beyond
pure fintech into banking.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Missed $1M ARR goal: Several factors contributed to missing our 2024 ARR target:
‚ó¶ Key deals delayed by holidays (Flutterwave, Pipe, Enable Finance)
‚ó¶ Coinbase prioritizing backlog remediation over contract expansion. We‚Äôre now working with them to
finalize the expansion, pending the completion of some additional model governance requirements.
‚ó¶ Two pilot disengagements (Cashfree, Nium) due to insufficient urgency qualification
‚ó¶ Over-reliance on Coinbase expansion for hitting our number
‚Ä¢ $45K loss on December Coinbase processing: A data ingestion pipeline issue affected 44% of reviews
(16,567 cases), requiring us to rerun cases at no charge. While Coinbase appreciated our transparency
and quick response, this wiped out our margins on the $130K of processing.
What we learned:
‚ó¶ Need for more rigorous production testing (implementing mandatory 100-case validation period)
‚ó¶ More investment in observability metrics and tooling
‚ó¶ Stricter code review requirements even for customer-specific branches

‚ó¶ Planning to hire dedicated QA specialist in Q1
‚Ä¢ Pricing model needs work: The Coinbase incident highlighted weaknesses in our pricing model:
‚ó¶ Current pricing doesn't adequately account for complexity and risk.
‚ó¶ Need better margins up front. We optimized the first Coinbase use case to higher margins (70-80%)
but didn‚Äôt have time to optimize models for the second one, resulting in losses.
‚ó¶ Looking at ways to differentiate pricing platform vs. usage.
üéØ Key Focus Areas for Q1:
‚Ä¢ Implementing more robust testing and monitoring.
‚Ä¢ Diversifying revenue with more medium-sized accounts (~$100K)
‚Ä¢ Developing scalable process for smaller accounts (~$20K) without custom pilots
‚Ä¢ Building stronger deal qualification and closing playbook
‚Ä¢ Considering first sales hire to help scale beyond tech-focused founder sales
Goals

‚ó¶ Enterprise Pipeline: Worldpay, AmEx, Block
‚Ä¢ Cash: $2,251,354
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$179K / ~13 months
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Model accuracy and cost improvements: As part of a final model governance and evaluation process
prior to going live with Coinbase we invested in improving accuracy and costs across multiple parts of
our extraction pipelines for AML screening. This resulted in increasing extraction success and accuracy
for adverse media articles from low 80s in pilot to 97%+. We also able to move to cheaper models
across the pipeline which will help reduce costs and increase margins.
‚Ä¢ Faster document validation: Almost all of our pilots this month involve KYB document verification (e.g.
incorporation docs, business ownership docs, proof of address, EIN letters). We‚Äôve built a new API
endpoint that allows our customers to validate these documents during onboarding in their onboarding
flow in less than 5 mins. We also created a playground to easily demo this capability (see video here)
‚Ä¢ Better monitoring a testing: Following an incident in December we invested in improving monitoring and
testing of our data pipelines across last month. We now have end to end coverage for our AML pipeline,
including unit tests, integration tests, and comprehensive evaluations for LLM workflows.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Coinbase rollout expansion still being finalized: This has been dragging for multiple months but we
made some good progress this month, finalizing requirements for all the workflows for with their
product and operations teams and getting annualized volume estimations. We have one more stage to
complete which is a final model governance evaluation of all our models this month. On the plus side the
integration for the first usecase was finally completed and successfully tested!
‚Ä¢ Scaled outbound not converting highly enough: We experimented with scaling up outbounding last
month using AI-personalized emails but saw a reply rate of <1%. We‚Äôre going to experiment with more
targeted messaging this month in addition to more handwritten emails.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update January 2024: Help us get more customers!
Parcha Investors,
Last month we closed our 3rd customer contract and now feel ready to ramp up selling our KYB automation
product to more customers. Our goal is to close $1M ARR this year and we need your help with intros to
customers!
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Paying customers: 3
‚Ä¢ Time To Build an Agent: ~1 week
‚Ä¢ Cash: $4,559,400
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$183K/~3yrs (Up due to outstanding legal invoices we paid off in one go, we
expect steady state to be ~$135K)
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Bancoli in production:The team worked tirelessly last month to tune the KYB agent for Bancoli which
will be our first high volume customer to integrate KYB via our API. We achieved 90% accuracy
compared to backtesting across the majority of tests and now are iterating based on feedback from
their compliance folks using our product side by side.
‚Ä¢ Closed Flutterwave: We closed Flutterwave as our 3rd paying customer and will start a pilot with them
this month for a partial KYB review focused on merchant categorization. This is a good opportunity for
us to test our ability to begin by providing a piece of our KYB product and then expand to automate the
whole KYB process.
‚Ä¢ Closed our last critical hire: Samuel Rivera joins us as a full-stack engineer who will be leading our
product experience development and has already made huge strides in improving our dashboard
experience as a contractor. We have now hired all the critical members of our eng team.
‚Ä¢ GTM Plan: We spent a day this week working on our GTM plan to get to our first $1M in ARR. Coming
out of that we were able to identify the metrics we will be tracking, the channels we will be focused
onand our ICP:
‚ó¶ Metrics:
‚ñ™ ARR (booked)
‚ñ™ # of accounts at design/scoping
‚ñ™ Demos scheduled.
‚ñ™ We will start tracking in these next month‚Äôs update
‚ó¶ Channels we‚Äôre focusing on / trying in Q1:
‚ñ™ Warm intros (80% of leads) - We really need your help with these!
‚ñ™ cold outreach (10% of leads)
‚ñ™ website SEO and thought leadership content (10% of leads)
‚ó¶ ICPs we‚Äôre going to be targeting initially:
‚ñ™ Company: B2B Fintech experiencing strong growth (20% per month) ideally serving SMBs
(higher volume, harder to KYB) with at least 2,000 customers onboarding per month, $10M+ in

funding, already have a compliance / ops team. They don‚Äôt have to be US based or have US
customers but their business operating language needs to be english.
‚ñ™ Personas:
‚Ä¢ Risk Operations Manager who is focused on reducing cost to onboard customers and has
budget to experiment with new vendors.
‚Ä¢ Risk PM who is focused onboarding more customers, faster, more cost-effectively (this was
me at Brex!).
‚Ä¢ Founder who is focused on improving efficiency/margins and exploring AI as a solution.
‚ó¶ We would love to get your feedback on the above, especially if you have experience with these
ICPs!
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Vastly underestimated time to production: This is more of a lowlight for the year as a whole but it took
us much longer to get our product into production that we thought it would. A big piece of this was that
we were trying to build a far too generalized AI agent to start with which had a lot more room for error.
By focusing on KYB we removed a lot of that risk but it still took a massive effort from the team to get all
the KYB checks working accurately. Over the next few months we will continue reducing the time it
takes to deliver value to our customers by adding more self serve features for configuring, tuning and
backtesting our product.

I‚Äôd like to introduce you to AJ Asver, Co-Founder of Parcha.ai. AJ and his co-founder Miguel, grew Brex‚Äôs
customer base 10x in a year and were motivated to start Parcha because of the bottlenecks they saw in
customer growth caused by manual compliance workflows requiring humans in the loop. Their product
makes KYB effortless for you and your customers. It uses AI to enable you to approve more customers,
faster with stronger compliance. AJ would like to learn more about how you are scaling your KYB processes
today and explore if Parcha could help.

Parcha Investors,
Last month we closed our 3rd customer contract and now feel ready to ramp up selling our KYB automation
product to more customers. Our goal is to close $1M ARR this year and we need your help with intros to
customers!
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked): $0 (we haven‚Äôt invoiced paid pilots yet)
‚ó¶ Pilots: 3 ($35K total ACV)
‚ó¶ Scoping: 7 (inc. Brex, Stripe, Coinbase)
‚ó¶ Demos Schedule last month: 21
‚Ä¢ Cash: $4,333,496
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$168K/~2yrs (Up due to +1 FTE, new office deposit, OpenAI costs)
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Shipped lots to customers: Last month we had lots of customer engagement from both Bancoli and
Flutterwave which results in lots of feedback and new features. Here‚Äôs what we shipped:
‚ó¶ Document extraction (incorporation, proof of address, and business ownership) support in 60+
languages
‚ó¶ New user interface, including better visibility for each check, real time status cards for addresses,
documents, business information, etc (see {demo})
‚ó¶ Multiple Proof of address improvements, including detection of lease agreements, and better
extraction of addresses from documents
‚ó¶ International tax identification number (TIN) validation
‚ó¶ Merchant categorization based on web research of a business
‚ó¶ Better user-driven configuration - weights of individual checks on final decision of approving /
reviewing / denying a customer, flagged vs. blocked countries, etc.
‚ó¶ Performance improvements: improved persistence and performance in our data layer, support for
webhooks in our API and KYC-only jobs
‚ó¶ Improved adverse media search
‚ó¶ Generating a follow-up message to customers based on outcome of review
‚ó¶ In product feedback support for every review and check
‚Ä¢ Positive customer feedback from pilots: We‚Äôve been getting really positive feedback from both
Flutterwave and Bancoli on the pilots we‚Äôre running.
‚ó¶ Flutterwave head of risk and compliance ops: ‚ÄúBased on the results of the POC, I plan to recommend
to our senior leadership team that we move forward with prioritizing the Parcha MCC work straight
to production. Thus, eliminating the need for a second POC. ... I can't thank your team enough for
everything put forth into the POC. You all are killing it!‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Sub 5 minute KYB: We made a breakthrough in parallelization last week that will enable us to bring the
time it takes to complete a KYB review using Parcha from ~20-30 mins to < 3mins. We believe this will

be a game changer for the KYB manual reviews which can take upwards of 1 hour when done by
humans! We‚Äôre very excited to share a live demo of this once we have it all hooked up to the frontend.
‚Ä¢ Moved into our own office: After reaching full capacity and dealing with an ant invasion, damp floors
and efflorescence we finally left our co-working space in Levi‚Äôs Plaza at the end of the year and moved
into our own space in Jackson sq this month. Please come visit us at 755 Sansome st.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Burn rate higher than anticipated: Our burn rate excluding payroll was higher than anticipated last
month. A few things that drove this: OpenAI API costs increasing as we started pilots plus legal
expenses, deposit, and furniture for new office. Our goal is to get net burn down below $140K extending
our runway into mid-2026, so we will be taking action to reduce costs this month.
‚Ä¢ ACVs: We want to get our ACVs up to $50-$100K but we‚Äôre closer to $17,000 right now with the Bancoli
and Flutterwave. The good news is that both Bancoli and Flutterwave have expansion opportunities that
we‚Äôre actively pursuing but speaking to customers in the last month we‚Äôve continued to see customers
with smaller onboarding volume. For now we‚Äôre willing to do pilots with customers with 200+ reviews
per month as we want to continue learning and iterating. In the meantime we‚Äôre going to further qualify
our target list to companies with higher volume. In addition, we‚Äôre continuing scoping conversations with
Brex, Stripe and Coinbase.

March 2024
Subject: Parcha Investor Update March 2024
Parcha Investors,
Last month we made improvements across all of our KYB / KYC checks thanks to our new compliance
analyst contractor providing daily feedback. On the other hand, conversion was our biggest pain point last
month across the business, whether it was closing contracts or closing hires, we didn‚Äôt convert well enough.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked): ~$3,600 (Bridge)
‚ó¶ Pilots/POCs: 4 (Coinbase, Stripe, Bancoli, Flutterwave)
‚ó¶ Scoping/Sandbox: 6 (Brex, Keep, Core10, Capchase, Check, Evergrow)
‚ó¶ Demos Schedule last month: 29
‚Ä¢ Cash: $4,172,380
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$143K/~29 months
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Demo Sandbox: We setup a demo sandbox last month to make it easier for customers to test out our
product at the scoping stage. 4 customers that we demo‚Äôed to in the last month are now testing out
Parcha in our sandbox including the onboarding team at Coinbase. It still takes a few hours to set the
sandboxes up however which we want to fix this month.
‚Ä¢ Accuracy feedback reporting: We added the ability for customers to provide feedback on agent
performance and see a summary of accuracy based on feedback. Customer based accuracy rating is at
98%+ though we hold ourselves to a higher accuracy bar based on our own internal quality control (see
below).
‚Ä¢ Onboarded KYB/KYC analyst to help improve check accuracy: We‚Äôve hired Colin Mason, a compliance
analyst with 7+ years experience working at Coinbase and other fintechs to help us test the agent and
provide a human fallback. Our motivation for this is two-fold: (1) tighten iterations cycles as we improve
accuracy by having an in-house user of the product and (2) test our ability to fully replace the KYB
function in an organization with an AI+human hybrid. We will report back next month on how it‚Äôs going.
‚Ä¢ New website focused on compliance automation ready to launch: We just wrapped up work on our
new website which more clearly articulates our value prop as an AI-powered automation solution for
KYB, not an AI Agent platform. In fact, we‚Äôve dropped the word agent from all of our public facing
content! We‚Äôre planning to launch the website next Tuesday on our new domain parcha.com! Here‚Äôs a
preview - please take a look and let us know your feedback.
‚Ä¢ Positive feedback from banks at Fintech Meetup: We met with a number of potential customers at
Fintech Meetup including Fifth Third bank, JP Morgan Embedded Finance and Bank of America who
were all interested in our product and impressed by the sub 3-minute KYB demo. Based on these
conversations, we believe there is an opportunity to distribute Parcha through sponsor banks as a way
for them to have stronger and more consistent compliance across their portfolio. This is especially
relevant given the latest round of enforcement actions in BaaS.
üëé Lowlights:

‚Ä¢ Converting pilots ‚Üí annual contracts is taking longer than we anticipated: We‚Äôre now 2 months into
pilots with both Bancoli and Flutterwave and still haven‚Äôt converted them to annual contracts:
‚ó¶ Bancoli: We‚Äôre been continuing to improve the products to meet their needs and are now on the
home straight with the last request being to open up the pilot to solo-preneurs not just SMBs.
‚ó¶ Flutterwave: We completed the MCC pilot in February and are now waiting for final approval from
their head of compliance on signing the annual contract as they recently had a re-org.
We remain optimistic that both pilots will convert but it‚Äôs definitely taken longer than we thought it we
would have liked. Moving forward we‚Äôre going to set clearer success criteria for pilots and have a better
process for managing stakeholders through the closing process.
‚Ä¢ Converting demos ‚Üí pilots also taking longer: We wanted to convert 3 demos to pilots last month but
only converted 2 companies to POCs (Stripe and Coinbase), which we had been working on for months.
Customers want to try the product themselves first before engaging in a pilot so we are now providing a
sandbox environment to test out Parcha. We will report back next month on whether this leads to higher
conversion or not.
‚Ä¢ We didn‚Äôt land an opportunistic exec hire we were excited about: The opportunity came up last month
to hire previous Brex colleague to lead GTM/Parnerships/Ops but unfortunately we weren‚Äôt able to seal
the deal, narrowly losing out to a series A fintech.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update April 2024
Parcha Investors,
Last month we closed $20K more in ARR, ran a successful POC with Coinbase and got to the final stages of
securing a pilot with a publicly traded sponsor bank that we are optimistic we will convert. We also saw
overall accuracy above 98% as measured by our customers.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked): ~$25,800 (Bridge, Bancoli, Flutterwave)
‚ó¶ Pilots/POCs: 2 (Coinbase, Stripe)
‚ó¶ Scoping/Sandbox: 6 (Brex, Core10, Capchase, Check, C2FO, FVBank)
‚ó¶ Demos Schedule last month: 13
‚Ä¢ Cash: $4,003,485
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$145K/~27.5 months
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Crushed Coinbase POC: We ran a POC where we ran 100 individuals through our Adverse Media check
with AI analysis and performed way better than existing vendors on false positives which will save
Coinbase‚Äôs team lots of time and resources. In addition, Coinbase thought our UX for reviewing adverse
media was very helpful in clearing false positives. The PM we‚Äôre working with has recommended moving
forward with a scaled pilot in production and we‚Äôre going to prioritizing their security requests this
month.
‚Ä¢ Customer attested accuracy over 98%: Our customers give us feedback on how accurate our AI is and
if that feedback is negative we don‚Äôt charge them for the review. Across all our customers we had over
98% accuracy.
‚Ä¢ Lots of feature improvements across the product:
‚ó¶ Added OpenCorporates integration for verifying business registration and controlling officers
‚ó¶ Improved adverse media check and UX to quickly review articles
‚ó¶ Added document summaries so customers can easily understand what‚Äôs in a document (e.g.
business registration) without opening it even if it‚Äôs not in english.
‚ó¶ Improved business ownership extraction logic to better handle tabulated data.
‚ó¶ Added document fraud detection via resistant.ai integration.
‚ó¶ Multiple reliability, speed, and robustness improvements in our API and AI infrastructure.
‚Ä¢ Progress with selling to banks: Last month I travelled to Wilmington NC to meet with the embedded
fintech and leadership team at Live Oak Bank, the largest SBA lender in the US. We believe they would
be a great partner to work with to prove the value we can provide to B2B banks as they use the same
KYB flow for their direct customers and their 3rd party embedded finance customers. They also have a
strong relationship with Alloy, and can help persuade Alloy to integrate with us. Besides Live Oak, we
also had productive conversations with US Bank, CC Bank, Lead and Fifth Third.

‚Ä¢ SOC 2 Type 2 compliance: We successfully completed our SOC 2 Type 2 audit, a critical step to being
ready to serve larger enterprises.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Less demos scheduled: We scheduled half as many demos last month as focus shifted to larger
enterprise accounts like Coinbase and Live Oak Bank. Moving forward we‚Äôre going to focus on a smaller
list of growth/enterprise sized fintechs and strategic banks as customers. You can see our new
target list here.
‚Ä¢ Unit costs too high: Our unit costs on LLMs meant we had negative margins on jobs we ran last month.
This is caused by a combination of us continuing to improve accuracy and add more features to the KYB
process while also giving our early customers very favorable pricing. We believe that inference costs will
improve when next generation of models are released by OpenAI later this year. In the meantime we‚Äôre
taking action this month to move some of our workloads onto Mistral which is much cheaper. Separately
we‚Äôre using our Azure credits to reduce development costs too.
‚Ä¢ Human-in-the-loop not cost effective yet: The human in the loop service we are trialling with Bridge
this month isn‚Äôt proving to be financial viable at the price we‚Äôre charging per job ($2). This is driven by
the fact at least 50% of our KYB analysts time is spent co-ordinating with Bridge‚Äôs customers and
operations team, not carrying out actual reviews. We‚Äôre going to make a few more improvements this
month to automate document workflow but we don‚Äôt think there is a path to automate the high-touch
co-ordination right now. On the plus side having direct feedback from our KYB analyst as he carries out
Bridge KYB reviews has helped us make lots of improvements that our other customers are benefiting
from too.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update April 2024
Parcha Investors,
We‚Äôve been heads down building for existing customers and new pilots. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new at Parcha...
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked): ~$29,000 (+24%)
‚ó¶ Pilots/POCs: 2 (Coinbase, Stripe, Rho, FVBank)
‚ó¶ Scoping/Sandbox: 3 (Brex RFP, FVBank, LiveOak, EnableFinance)
‚ó¶ Demos Schedule last month: 8
‚Ä¢ Cash: $3,860,000
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$164K/~24 months (+up due to LLM costs and one-off contractor payment)
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Our existing customers want more: All three of our existing customers want us to help them automate
more of their KYB/KYC workflows:
‚ó¶ Bridge are interested in using us to review and clear PEP alerts for KYC (we currently only handle
KYB)
‚ó¶ Bancoli are working with us to automatically approve customers based on our AI reviews and
automatically remediate document requests.
‚ó¶ Flutterwave have asked for our help to process adverse media alerts where they are seeing lots of
false positives.
In total we see an opportunity to 4X ARR just from our existing customers in the next quarter, in additio
to the organic growth in reviews we‚Äôre seeing from those customers (+24% last month)
‚Ä¢ We‚Äôre engaged in two enterprise pilots: We are working on a pilot with Coinbase and Stripe for KYC
screening and UDAP respectively. Each of these pilots are massive opportunities for Parcha to land
marquee customers and expand ARR singificantly. The team is working really hard to make both of them
successful over the next couple of months. Feedback has been very positive so far from both
companies.
‚Ä¢ We‚Äôre seeing demand for KYC workflows: We‚Äôve recently seen a lot more interest from prospective
customers like Coinbase to support KYC workflows. In particular, false positive alerts from screening
solutions like ComplyAdvantage, Refinitiv and Thomson Reuters create a lot of human review overhead
for consumer fintechs. We see this as a massive opportunity to reach more customers with higher ACV
given the order of magnitude more B2C fintechs and consumer customers there are.
‚Ä¢ We won a billboard in Time Square: Thanks to our friends at Brex, we got a free billboard at time square
during New York Tech week. Initialized connected us with an agency that‚Äôs going to help us maximize
the opportunity and gave us 15 hours of free creative work! We‚Äôre planning to use AI to create the assets
too, so this should be a very cost effective marketing opportunity.
‚Ä¢ Started testing cheaper models: Per our update last month our unit economics are too high since we
switched to GTP-4 turbo. Last month we made some infrastructure updates that will make it much

easier for us to test cheaper models and open source options, which will give us flexibility to optimize
costs. We should see this start to pay off as we close new contracts.
‚Ä¢ Shipped document remediation into demo: We now have an end-to-end document remediation API
that can be integrated into a customer‚Äôs onbaording process to automatically collect and remediate
documents. Think persona/socure but for business documents. You can see a demo here. Note we‚Äôre
going to speed this up!
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Didn‚Äôt sign any new customers: We didn‚Äôt convert any new paying customers last month, with are two
largest pilots still ongoing. We need to convert at least one pilot in a paying customer this month.
‚Ä¢ We‚Äôre not ready for self-serve onboarding yet: We tried onboarding Capchase straight into our
sandbox in a self-serve manor and it didn‚Äôt result in a good experience of Parcha. This taught us that we
still have a lot of work to do upfront to customize Parcha to each customers use case before they start
using it, even for a POC. We‚Äôre investing in speeding up this process but for the time being we will stick
to a more hands-on onboarding process. This necessitates that we focus on customers with high
enough ACV potential, ideally $50K-$100K to make it worth our while.
‚Ä¢ LLM costs still too high: We exited April with $2.5K higher OpenAI costs than in March. We should seen
this go down in May for a couple of reasons:
‚ó¶ We moved all development consumption to Azure and AWS where we have ~$400K in credits to
consume.
‚ó¶ We‚Äôre starting to use cheaper models for some workloads, for example Anthropic‚Äôs Haiku which is
24X cheaper than GPT-4 Turbo which we have been using exclusively since it was released.
‚ó¶ We‚Äôre starting to explore open-source models for some workloads but this is still very early.
‚Ä¢ SAAS renewals impending: We had a lot of SaaS products discounted for the first year that are coming
up on renewal with higher prices. We will be going through all of them this month and deciding what we
need to keep vs. drop.
  Asks
Customer intros:
We would love to speak to more fintech companies in our ICP: B2B Fintech experiencing strong growth
deally serving SMBs (higher volume, harder to KYB) that could be KYB or KYC. They don‚Äôt have to be US

Subject: Parcha Investor Update April 2024
Parcha Investors,
We still didn‚Äôt convert any new customers last month and saw ARR go down as usage reduced from one or
our customers. This month we‚Äôre laser focused on converting Coinbase and Brex and expanding
Flutterwave to a new workflow. We‚Äôre also doing a deeper dive into our sales funnel to understand what we
need to do better to improve conversion.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked): ~$26,000 (-20%)
‚ó¶ Pilots/POCs: 3 (Coinbase, Brex, Stripe, FVBank)
‚ó¶ Sandbox: 2 (Brex, Ramp)
‚ó¶ Demos Schedule last month: 14
‚Ä¢ Cash: $3,712,107
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$145K/~24 months
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ New Adverse Media Pipeline for Coinbase: The team were heads down last month working on a new
adverse media pipeline for a pilot we are doing with Coinbase. Unlike our existing pilot, this doesn‚Äôt use
our own news search but instead reviews articles found using Coinbase‚Äôs existing adverse media
provider vendor. The value Parcha provides is reducing false positives and speeding up the process of
clearing potential hits. So far we‚Äôve seen that we can clear over 90% of false positives in testing.
‚Ä¢ Reduced LLM costs: We moved more of our R&D costs to Azure and AWS to use credits we have on
both platforms. In addition we switch high volume workloads over to cheaper models like Haiku. This
reduced overall LLM spend from $5K to $3K in May.
‚Ä¢ We published our first case study showing how we reduce manual review times for Bancoli by 90% in
90 days. You can read it here.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Usage reduced from Bridge: Last month human our KYB analyst transitioned to become a full time
employee at Bridge. With this transition we also disabled a script that was running all bridge cases
automatically, allowing the analyst to run cases manually as required. We saw that this resulted in Bridge
running less cases. This suggests that Parcha wasn‚Äôt as useful for Bridge for all KYB cases which we will
dig deeper into this month.
‚Ä¢ Still haven‚Äôt signed any new customers: There are three issues we‚Äôre seeing that are contributing to not
closing more customers:
‚ó¶ Customers not advancing passed demo: Despite demo‚Äôing to dozens of potential customers in the
last 9 months, we haven‚Äôt been able convert enough from a demo to scoping discussion. We aimed
to convert 20-30% but have converted closer to 10% from demo to a scoping meeting.
‚ó¶ We‚Äôre not converting from the POC stage to paying customer well enough:
‚ñ™ We lost the Rho account to a competitor (Accend) who had a better online due diligence solution
than us.

‚ñ™ Coinbase is a long sales cycle. We started with a POC, are doing the Pilot this month and will not
convert the account until July.
‚ñ™ Stripe has been slow to respond after the initial POC, suggesting a shift in priorities on their end
thought we‚Äôre continuing to push on this.
‚ó¶ Our sales process is not thorough enough: we need to do a better job of following-up regularly and
often after the first meeting and re-engaging when we have updates and new features.
Next steps on improving conversion
We still have high conviction that there is a need for what we‚Äôre building, but we need to understand
whether it‚Äôs a lack of urgency, our sales process or the way we‚Äôre packaging the product itself that is
resulting in low conversion. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing to better understand this:
‚Ä¢ Talking to customers: We‚Äôre re-engaging with all customers that we demo‚Äôed to better understand why
we didn‚Äôt convert them.
‚Ä¢ Crushing the Coinbase pilot: This is a critical enterprise customer we have to close and the team is
working really hard to make sure the pilot goes well.
‚Ä¢ Win the Brex RFP: We‚Äôre in a bakeoff with our competitors and need to prove that Parcha is the best
product for growth stage fintechs like Brex.
‚Ä¢ Improving product: Making improvements to our business due diligence check, an area where we are
weaker than our competitors. We‚Äôre adding a more comprehensive due diligence report with social
media scraping, deeper web crawling and additional sources like Crunchbase. We should not lose
another deal because of this.
‚Ä¢ Improving demos:
‚ó¶ Adding a product tour to our website which will make it much easier for customers to get a sense of
how the product works without the need to get Sandbox access, which causes friction today.
‚ó¶ Adjusting our sandbox environment to be more focused on showing how the product works than
showing the outcome of a case.
‚Ä¢ Improving sales process: Getting an outsourced contractor to support me on running the sales process.
This includes includes prep for meetings, sending timely follow-up emails, regular re-engagement
emails, CRM management, Linkedin engagement etc. I will still do all sales calls. The goal is to be able to
run a more thorough sales while I‚Äôm still heavily involved in product.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update July 2024
Parcha Investors,
We finally converted FVBank into a paid customer last month and setup a POC with Ramp but the Coinbase
pilot was delayed to this week and we‚Äôre yet to hear back from Brex on a decision on their RFP. Meanwhile
we deconstructed our sales process and have lots improvements this month so we will be ramping up demo
170,194again.
What Parcha does:
We‚Äôre building an AI-powered compliance suite for fintechs and banks to accelerate their KYB/KYC manual
compliance reviews. Today there are three main use cases we are focused on:
1. Automated document validation: This is a big painpoint for B2B fintechs when onboarding businesses as
documents vary by jurisdiction and KYB processes. No existing vendors solve this well.
2. Business due diligence: B2B fintechs need to carry out extensive due diligence on their customers
including understanding what type of products the business sells, what industry it operates in, who the
business owners are, what their online presence is and much more. This is all done very manually today.
3. AML Screening: Over 90% of alerts from adverse media, sanctions, watchlist and PEP screening are
false positive. This creates a massive review overhead for fintechs both during onboarding at when
monitoring transactions. Parcha‚Äôs AI can reduce false positives by 90%.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ 30Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked): ~$30,000 (+15%)
‚ó¶ Monthly Reviews: 3,620 (+3K Flutterwave backlog)
‚ó¶ Pilots/POCs: 5 (Coinbase, Brex, Ramp, 2 new Flutterwave usecases)
‚ó¶ Demos Schedule last month: 5 (paused while we improved sales process)
‚Ä¢ Cash: $3,526,970
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$170,194K/~21 months (Legal + DS contractor)
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Flutterwave expansion: We‚Äôre working on two new usecases from flutterwave, for enhanced business
due diligence and Visa merchant compliance. Both use cases were brought to us by Flutterwave as they
are excited to apply Parcha to more of their manual processes. In addition Flutterwave ran 3,000
reviews from their backlog last month.
‚Ä¢ New business due diligence report: We lost a deal in May because our business due diligence report
wasn‚Äôt good enough. Last month we invested across the integrations, data pipeline, AI and product
experience to make it way better. Our existing customers Bancoli and Flutterwave are excited to start
using the BDD report ASAP and we believe it will help us win more KYB deals.
‚Ä¢ Multimodal model integration: We‚Äôre now using multimodal models to verify and validate documents for
our customers. This allows us to check if an IRS letter has the proper logo or a business registration has
a seal and signature for example. A feature many prospective customers like Ramp have asked for. It will
also allow us to reduce our reliance on Google‚Äôs OCR engine.
‚Ä¢ Prompt optimization system: One of the biggest challenges we‚Äôve been facing is how to systematically
improve our prompts at scale without causing unexpected regressions. We now have a system for doing

this by evaluating inputs and outputs across a large dataset and generating a new prompt using AI and
then testing it against the previous outputs.
‚Ä¢ Identified lots of improvements to sales funnel: After speaking to a bunch of experienced sales folks
we identified a few areas in our sales process that we need to improve:
‚ó¶ Significantly ramp up outbound: We need to approach more people within a prospect and do so
directly vs. relying on just investor intros.
‚ó¶ Better discovery and qualification in first call and less demo‚Äôing: We need to ask more questions up
front and really understand how much of a pain we‚Äôre solving with Parcha
‚ó¶ Tighter sales process: Lots of tactical improvements including how we run each call to get the
desired outcome, how we work with the champion to move the deal along and how we effectively
engage with all stakeholders.
Overall we are going to run a much more rigorous sales process to improve conversion.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Coinbase pilot delayed: We had to delay the Coinbase pilot by two weeks because we needed to
change the way we were integrating with their systems. This could have been avoided if we had done
better technical scoping upfront and we‚Äôre going to improve our pilot scoping process based on what
we learned.
‚Ä¢ Brex RFP delayed: We‚Äôre still waiting on feedback from Brex on our RFP proposal. With end of quarter
plus July 4th break we‚Äôre expecting to get more feedback in the next few weeks.
‚Ä¢ Burn higher this month: Our burn was too high this month driven by legal fees for commercial contracts
and a one-off contracting expense for the prompt optimization system. We‚Äôre going to be reducing legal
costs moving forward by working with a contractor for day-to-day legal work rather than Freshfields
and ended the contract with the data scientist that was helping us with prompt optimization. We‚Äôre also
continuing to consolidate more of our infrastructure to reduce hosting costs.
‚Ä¢ Team stretched across use cases: We‚Äôre once again feeling stretched across too many use cases and
need to find a path to focus more. Once we complete the Coinbase, Brex and Ramp pilots this month we
will have more data to decide which use cases to focus on.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update August 2024
Parcha Investors,
We completed a successful pilot with Coinbase last month and are working with the PM to get a full rollout
approved by leadership. We also have three new pilots started including a publicly traded bank and have
more enterprise customers in the pipeline.
What Parcha does:
We‚Äôre building an AI-powered compliance suite for fintechs and banks to accelerate their KYB/KYC manual
compliance reviews. Today there are three main use cases we are focused on:
1. Automated document validation: This is a big painpoint for B2B fintechs when onboarding businesses as
documents vary by jurisdiction and KYB processes. No existing vendors solve this well.
2. Business due diligence: B2B fintechs need to carry out extensive due diligence on their customers
including understanding what type of products the business sells, what industry it operates in, who the
business owners are, what their online presence is and much more. This is all done very manually today.
3. AML Screening: Over 90% of alerts from adverse media, sanctions, watchlist and PEP screening are
false positive. This creates a massive review overhead for fintechs both during onboarding at when
monitoring transactions. Parcha‚Äôs AI reduces false positives by 90%, speeding up the screening up the
screening process of individuals and businesses.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked): ~$35,000 (+16%)
‚ó¶ Monthly Reviews: 3,048
‚ó¶ Pilots/POCs: 6 (Valley Bank, Pipe, EnableFinance, Coinbase, Brex, Ramp)
‚ó¶ Demos Schedule last month:
‚ó¶ Enterprise Pipeline: Airwallex, Paxos, Nium, Worldpay, Visa, Amex
‚Ä¢ Cash: $3,378,000
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$150K / ~2yrs
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Successful Coinbase pilot: The team has been working super hard over the last 3 months on a pilot to
accelerate AML reviews for Coinbase which we completed last month. Overall Coinbase were happy
with the outcome with the PM saying that the compliance analysts found our product much easier to
use than Refinitiv. There were some challenges during the pilot with getting the right data into our
product that were a function of Coinbase‚Äôs internal systems that we are confident can be overcome
when expanding to a full rollout. We were however able to reduce false positives by almost 50% and
reduce the number of hits that needed to be reviewed by 90%. The deal is not done yet but initial
indication from the PM we have been working with is that they are going to recommend moving forward
with a full rollout, pending approval from their leadership team. Next steps are supporting that approval
process and finalizing commercials.
‚Ä¢ 3 more pilots: With go-to-market efforts ramping back up we signed up three new pilots over the last
month including Valley, a publicly traded US bank with 230 branch locations across several states,
including New Jersey, New York, Florida, Alabama, California, and Illinois. Valley was interested in using

Parcha to speed up document reviews, starting with their Cannabis banking business which has
particularly onerous KYB processes. The pilot will officially start in September but we‚Äôre adding a few
new features to support this month including the ability to provide example documents for our AI to
compare against.
‚Ä¢ Business due diligence for anyone to try: We now have a version of our in-depth business due
diligence report that anyone can and we would love to get your feedback on it before we share it
publicly. Head over to https://preview.parcha.ai/search to try it out and let us know what you think. We
plan to launch this feature and add it the search functionality to our home page later this month. It is
already being used by Bancoli and Flutterwave.
‚Ä¢ Real-time document remediation: We launched our real-time document remediation feature last month
and have already seen interest in the feature from Paxos, Airwallex and Pipe.
‚Ä¢ Burn rate back down: We got our burn rate back down to ~$150K giving us about 2 years of runway
remaining.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Unit economics on Coinbase pilot: We over-used more expensive models like Sonnet 3.5 in the
Coinbase pilot to maximize success but this meant the pilot had low margin of ~20%. If we move
forward with a full rollout, we have work to do to optimize the models we‚Äôre using, potentially fine-tuning
smaller models to get the same results at a much lower cost. We need to reduce costs by at least 50%.
‚Ä¢ Outbounding: we didn‚Äôt hit our very aggressive goal of outbounding 500 leads for a few reasons:
‚ó¶ We had to pause on LinkedIn outbounding for a week as my account got a bot detection warning.
We need to be super careful here as Linkedin is critical channel so we‚Äôre going to try a few different
tools to reduce risk of getting banned. If anyone has linkedin automation tools you recommend,
please let us know!
‚ó¶ We hadn‚Äôt warmed up additional domains for email outbound yet so we couldn‚Äôt ramp up this
channel. We‚Äôre warming multiple alternative domains this month.
This we‚Äôre working on a more co-ordinated outbound process with a combination of Linkedin, email and
website analytics. If you have go-to tools for this process, please let us know!
‚Ä¢ Paused FV Bank rollout as we have some concerns about how they want to use our data for a
potentially competitive product in the future. We‚Äôre working with them to get clarity on this.
‚Ä¢ Ramp pilot delayed as the PM we working with went on paternity leave. We plan to pick it back up in
September.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update September 2024
Parcha Investors,
We‚Äôre finally starting to experience some lift with growth/enterprise sized pilots with Coinbase at the final
stages of signing and 4 pilots in flight. We‚Äôre now focused on getting to 10 enterprise customers over the
next 10 weeks. Our goal by December is to be on a path to $1M in ARR and establish ourselves as the
enterprise player in this space. Given the momentum we‚Äôre looking to hire a founding backend engineer to
help us scale over the next few months.
Reminder: What Parcha does
We‚Äôre building an AI-powered compliance suite for fintechs and banks to accelerate their KYB/KYC manual
compliance reviews. Today there are three main use cases we are focused on:
1. Automated document validation: This is a big painpoint for B2B fintechs when onboarding businesses as
documents vary by jurisdiction and KYB processes. No existing vendors solve this well.
2. Business due diligence: B2B fintechs need to carry out extensive due diligence on their customers
including understanding what type of products the business sells, what industry it operates in, who the
business owners are, what their online presence is and much more. This is all done very manually today.
3. AML Screening: Over 90% of alerts from adverse media, sanctions, watchlist and PEP screening are
false positive. This creates a massive review overhead for fintechs both during onboarding at when
monitoring transactions. Parcha‚Äôs AI reduces false positives by 90%, speeding up the screening up the
screening process of individuals and businesses.
üëã Asks:
Help with hiring backend engineer
We are ramping up a search for a backend engineer with Python experience. We‚Äôve taken our with this hire

or other data-intensive applications.
‚ó¶ Deep Python expertise. Even better if they‚Äôve developed systems using async workflow execution
(e.g. Celery) or building workflows on systems like Prefect, Dagster, etc.
‚Ä¢ Startup experience. Ideally, previous experience as founding engineer or early hire at at a startup.

üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked): ~$29,068 (+16%)
‚ó¶ Monthly Reviews: 892 (-70%)
‚ó¶ Active Pilots: Valley Bank, Pipe, EnableFinance, AirWallex
‚ó¶ Pilots in pipeline: Ramp (restarting), Stripe (restarting), Cashfree, FIS/Atelio, Mercury, Navabank.
‚ó¶ Demos Schedule last month: 20
‚ó¶ Enterprise Pipeline: Paxos, Nium, Worldpay, Visa,
‚Ä¢ Cash: $3,221,807
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$150K / ~23 months
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Coinbase rollout approved: We got the great news this month that Coinbase‚Äôs leadership team
approved rolling out Parcha into production. The PM at Coinbase also told us that our pilot was now the
gold standard for other AI pilots at Coinbase and our model governance documentation was better than
they had seen from other vendors. We‚Äôre now at the final stages of signing the contract which will
~$500K annually ü§û. Coinbase also wants us to work on a new usecase for them which is a good proof
point for our land and expand enterprise strategy.
‚Ä¢ Inbound interest: We saw inbound interest in Parcha increase last month with 10 demos booked from
our website. We‚Äôre ramping up content on Linkedin and creating more product marketing to increase
awareness of Parcha.
‚Ä¢ More pilots interest: We have more pilots in the pipeline this month with Cashfree, FIS/Atelio and
Mercury. We‚Äôre also restarting pilots with Ramp and Stripe.
‚Ä¢ FIS accelerator: We got admitted into the FIS accelerator which will be a great opportunity to connect
with more traditional banks to understand where Parcha fits in, as well as build a POC with FIS‚Äôs BaaS
platform Atelio.
‚Ä¢ Reduced LLM costs: We‚Äôve been working with Anthropics team to test our prompt caching which will
allows to reduce LLM costs by ~15% for the Coinbase contract.
‚Ä¢ Reduced document review latency: One big piece of feedback we got from Airwallex on real-time
document reviews was that they needed to be faster to be included in onboarding. We‚Äôve also been
using the latest Gemini Flash models from Google to further reduce latency for document reviews by
removing the need for a separate OCR process. We‚Äôve now reduced the time to review a doc from >1
minute to <30 seconds on average. For shorter documents its less than 20 seconds.
‚Ä¢ FV Bank going into production: We were able to resolve the contractual issues and FB bank will be
going into production with Parcha‚Äôs document review API in the next couple of weeks.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ ARR/Reviews lower: Our ARR (based on monthly revenue) and number of revenues were down this
month. This is primarily driven by two factors:
‚ó¶ Flutterwave carried out two batch jobs last month and the month before which they didn‚Äôt this
month. The good news here is we‚Äôre finally close to signing an annual contract that will remove this
lumpiness and more importantly will be at much higher volume as they are moving forward with
integrating Parcha‚Äôs MCC agent into their onboarding flow. They are also going to be expanding to 2
more use cases in addition to the 2 they are doing with us right now.

‚ó¶ Bancoli volume lower: Not within our control but one of the downsides of having smaller early
design partners. Moving forward we‚Äôre focused on growth stage and enterprise customers.
‚Ä¢ Not moving forward with Brex: Unfortunately Brex will not be moving forward with an integration with
Parcha. After a year of trying to scope a potential integration and going through a lengthy RFP process
Brex decided that our product wasn‚Äôt ready to yet. Brex did a one time test on a very early version of our
KYC compliance reports a few months ago. We got some helpful feedback and have made multiple
improvements since then. We got the impression from the ops team that they didn‚Äôt end up picking
another vendor nor would have the resources to move forward with an integration if we addressed all
the issues raised. Therefore, we don‚Äôt plan to pursue this further right now given the other enterprise
customers we have lined up.
‚Ä¢ Burn increasing this month: We expect burn to go up starting this month as we get more backend
support, carry out a new Pen test, complete more security/privacy certifications and have exhausted
our AWS credits for Anthropic.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update October 2024
Parcha Investors,
We‚Äôre now engaged in pilots with some of the top fintechs in the world including Pipe, Airwallex, Nium,
Flutterwave, and Ramp. We‚Äôre also scoping a second use case with Coinbase that will prove our ability to
land and expand in an enterprise setting. Pilots are taking longer to complete than anticipated ( so we‚Äôre
modifying our goal from 10 customers in 10 weeks to 10 pilots in 10 weeks.
Reminder: What Parcha does
We‚Äôre building an AI-powered compliance suite for fintechs and banks to accelerate their KYB/KYC manual

üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked): ~$35,000 (Coinbase+Flutterwave annual contracts not yet signed)
‚ó¶ Monthly Reviews: 1,005 (+12%)
‚ó¶ Active Pilots: Pipe, E$nableFinance, AirWallex, Cashfree, Ramp, Nium
‚ó¶ Pilots in pipeline: Stripe (restarting), Mercury, Navabank, FIS Atelio
‚ó¶ Demos Scheduled last month: 20
‚ó¶ Enterprise Pipeline: Paxos, Worldpay, Visa, Toast
‚Ä¢ Cash: $3,076,487
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$137K / ~23 months
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Coinbase second use case: Coinbase has approved a second use case of Parcha for carrying out due
diligence on individuals after a transaction monitoring alert is triggered to determine if the individual‚Äôs
background matches the transaction. This is a new pipeline for us that we‚Äôre building in partnership with
them that we can then provide to other customers with similar use cases, and to improve the due
diligence we already do on business owners. They‚Äôve budgeted an additional ~$500K for this but we‚Äôre
still scoping out volume, cost and pricing. We‚Äôre excited to keep expanding to more use cases with this
marquee customer. The PM we‚Äôre working with at Coinbase has been demo-ing Parcha to many
different parts of the org and our pilot has become the gold standard for working with AI vendors.
‚Ä¢ Flutterwave integration: Flutterwave is finally ready to integrate Parcha into their onboarding flow vs.
manually entering data into our system as they have been so far. They‚Äôre working out volume so that we
can sign an annual contract with them vs. pay as you go terms they are on now. We expect this to be
~50-100K reviews a year. Furthermore we‚Äôre pitching Flutterwave on becoming their lifecycle
compliance management solution, a need they identified at a recent risk offsite with BCG. The goal is to
provide an intelligence risk management platform that plugs into all their existing compliance workflows
and vendors to accelerate their business. This aligns well with our long term vision for Parcha so we‚Äôre
going to push hard to persuade them to be our design partner. We have most of the pieces to build this
today but need to connect them together for a real customer. Once we build the lifecycle solution for
Flutterwave we can then upsell it to other enterprise customers too!

‚Ä¢ Infra costs cut in half: We reduced our infra costs signficantly in September giving us some extra room
for hiring an addition backend eng without driving burn up too high. We‚Äôre currently working with a few
contractors to fill the eng gap while we interview for the new role.
‚Ä¢ Lots of progress on pilots:
‚ó¶ EnableFinance were so happy with our KYB due diligence workflow they are now using Parcha end-
to-end and getting feedback from their underwriting partners on the due diligence we generate.
‚ó¶ We were able to reduce adverse media hits for Pipe by 80% with a 98% accuracy rating as evaluated
by their team.
‚ó¶ We reduced the time it takes to verify a document from over minute to under 30 seconds for
Airwallex based on their feedback.
‚ó¶ Cashfree have been highly engaged on our MCC solution. Even though we didn‚Äôt hit the success
criteria on the first round of evaluations, we used our own evaluator to show them that some of their
backtesting labels were not correct and are not working with them to further tune the MCC
categorizer. They are already interested in using Parcha for more workflows!
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Coinbase procurement delays: We‚Äôre at the final stages of signing with Coinbase. At this point we‚Äôve
got leadership approval, gone through the procurement process, completed vendor onboarding and are
already working on the integration with their eng team. If you have any tips on how to get this last step
completed please let me know!!!

‚Ä¢ Pilots taking longer than expected to complete: All the pilot we started engaging on in August are
taking longer than expected, primarily due to resourcing constraints on our customer side. We need to
better factor this into our timelines and goals moving forward as it‚Äôs a reality when working with large
fintechs like Airwallex, Pipe or FIS. We‚Äôve modified our 10 week goal as a result to be 10 pilots run in 10
weeks rather than 10 customers signed in 10 weeks.
‚Ä¢ Alloy integration is becoming a blocker: The most common integration we‚Äôre asked about today is
Alloy, which is used for KYB/KYC orchestration by many fintechs including Pipe, Ramp and Airwallex. We
have been building a relationship with the partnership team at Alloy but they want to see the results of
the pilots we are running with their customers before engaging in an official integration. This puts us in a
catch-22 situation because our customers want to see how Parcha will work with Alloy as part of the
pilots! To solve for this we‚Äôre working with Alloy to put a partnership agreement in place. This will be a
huge win as it will give us distribution through their platform too!
‚Ä¢ Valley Bank pilot delayed: Valley bank is delaying a pilot with us until they have completed their 2025
planning process. We were going to start the pilot but once we shared the success metrics and
resources required by them they got cold feet. The upside is that we got clarity on this sooner rather
than later by documenting the pilot. Our champion at Vally has also indicated that there are goals being
prioritized for 2025 that we can plug into.
‚Ä¢ Bank go-to-market not yet understood: We still haven‚Äôt worked out how to successfully sell into large
regional banks. With both LiveOak and Alloy there was a lot of initial enthusiasm but it didn‚Äôt materialize
when we actually needed to get resources to run the pilot. We need to understand this segment better.
Here‚Äôs some ways we‚Äôre doing this:
‚ó¶ FIS accelerator is helping us with introductions to regional banks so we can better understand their
painpoints
‚ó¶ Attending the Castle Creek summit next week with multiple bank executives to better understand
their buying process and priorities as well as how they view AI.
‚ó¶ Hosting a banking focused dinner at Money2020 with non c-suite operators in product, operations
and compliance at large banks.
Our goal is to really understand when and how to break into this market.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update November 2024
Parcha Investors,
We finally signed the deal with Coinbase and are already working on second use case. Meanwhile we‚Äôre
scoping out a much deeper integration with Flutterwave‚Äôs compliane workflows and we‚Äôre completing pilots
with FIS, Airwallex, Pipe, EnableFinance and Cashfree.
Reminder: What Parcha does
We‚Äôre building an AI-powered compliance suite for fintechs and banks to accelerate their KYB/KYC manual
compliance reviews. Today there are three main use cases we are focused on:
1. Automated document validation: This is a big painpoint for B2B fintechs when onboarding businesses as
documents vary by jurisdiction and KYB processes. No existing vendors solve this well.
2. Business due diligence: B2B fintechs need to carry out extensive due diligence on their customers
including understanding what type of products the business sells, what industry it operates in, who the
business owners are, what their online presence is and much more. This is all done very manually today.
3. AML Screening: Over 90% of alerts from adverse media, sanctions, watchlist and PEP screening are
false positive. This creates a massive review overhead for fintechs both during onboarding at when
monitoring transactions. Parcha‚Äôs AI reduces false positives by 90%, speeding up the screening up the
screening process of individuals and businesses.

Help with hiring backend and applied AI engineer
We are ramping up a search for both a backend engineer and an Applied AI engineer with Python
experience. Their ideal profile is:
Backend Engineer:
‚Ä¢ 5++ years of experience scaling systems at fast-growing companies. Bonus if they‚Äôve done it in AI / ML
or other data-intensive applications.
‚ó¶ Deep Python expertise. Even better if they‚Äôve developed systems using async workflow execution

Applied AI Engineer:
‚Ä¢ Deep expertise in modern LLMs and their applications, ideally using them in production at scale.
Experience with LLM backtesting and a strong foundation in ML evaluation and testing.
For both roles:
‚Ä¢ Startup experience. Ideally, previous experience as founding engineer or early hire at at a startup.
‚Ä¢ Based in SF and excited to work in our office 5 days a week.
Customer intros:
We would love to speak to more fintech companies in our ICP: B2B Fintech experiencing strong growth that
are bottlenecked by KYB or KYC reviews. They don‚Äôt have to be US based or have US customers but their

business operating language needs to be english.
You can see latest list of target customers here. The ideal person to intro us to is the product or business
owner for onboarding not the head of compliance. Let us know if you can help with an intro and we will send
over a blurb.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked + realized): ~$539,000
‚ó¶ Monthly Reviews: 1,252 (+25%)
‚ó¶ Active Pilots: ~$665,000 Forecasted (Pipe, EnableFinance, AirWallex, Cashfree, Nium, FIS Atelio,
Coinbase Transaction Alerts)
‚ó¶ Pilots in pipeline: ~$700K+ Forecasted (Mercury, Navebank, Paxos, Live Oak Bank, Worldpay)
‚ó¶ Demos Scheduled last month: 24
‚ó¶ Enterprise Pipeline: Visa, Toast, Mastercard, Plaid
‚Ä¢ Cash: $2,890,763
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$169K / ~17 months
Note: In our last investor update we reported a burn rate of $137,000 which was incorrect. Actual burn rate
last month was $159,000 and 19 months of runway. The error was due to us using an estimated burn rate
prior to closing the month.
üëç Highlights:
Coinbase $500K deal closed with $500k-$1M expansion opportunity in Q1
We finally closed Coinbase as our first enterprise public co with a $500K minimum annual contract for
accelerated AML screening. This was a massive effort from the whole team and a year long journey from
initial demo to closing the deal. Our PM champion at Coinbase put their career on the line to champion
Parcha. We built trust through multiple POCs, in depth partnership on a model governance and a willingness
to do whatever it took to make close the deal. In doing so we established Parcha as the gold standard for AI
pilots at Coinbase. That‚Äôs unlocked more use cases with one more already being scoped for Q1 with a
$500K-$1M ARR opportunity long term.
Reduced LLM costs to achieve ~80% margins
We invested significant time in multiple initiatives that have significantly reduced costs in our AML product:
1. Simplifying our workflows into simpler steps that utilize more cost-effective LLMs.
2. Refining our prompts, enhancing our backtesting infrastructure, and using novel techniques such as in-
context learning to ensure that workflows on these less expensive LLMs match the performance of our
previous systems.
These efforts have led to a cost reduction of over 80% per AML check, decreasing from 80 cents to
approximately 15 cents.
Closed a new eng hire (Brex, Meta alum)

We have a new engineer joining our team, Shaw Xia who we previously worked with at Brex. Shaw brings to
the team full stack experience and applied AI experience plus a deep understanding of how to scale python
backends from his time at Instagram. We‚Äôre really excited for Shaw to joining. His first day is tomorrow!
Integrating with Alloy
We have finally convince Alloy to work with us as a partner, primarily driven by the demand from multiple of
the their existing customers, most urgently Pipe. We‚Äôre scoping out the integration which will require Alloy to
provide eng resourcing. We expect to have an initial integration complete in early Q1!
üëé Lowlights:
We‚Äôre didn‚Äôt to close 10 customers in 10 weeks
Our goal for this year has been to reach $1M in ARR. In September we shared the following in our investor
update:
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre now focused on getting to 10 enterprise customers over the next 10
weeks. Our goal by December is to be on a path to $1M in ARR and
establish ourselves as the enterprise player in this space.‚Äù
Ten weeks later we did not close 10 customers for the following reasons:
‚Ä¢ Eng spread too thin: Scaling multiple enterprise pilots while supporting current customers has been
hugely challenging too. We currently have two and a half AI engineers (including Miguel) spread through
all three product areas: AML, BDD, and Documents. While the underlying platform it‚Äôs the same, all three
products require focus and a significant time investment. Moreover, the product needs of our current
customers not always overlap with those of our pilot customers. Since we are constantly switching
between product areas and customer / pilot needs, we are finding ourselves trading off customer
happiness with acquiring new customers and with making our AI products more robust.
‚Ä¢ Coinbase rollout: At the same time we underestimated the work required to get Coinbase production
ready. From scaling infra to completing model governance work has taken up almost half of all eng
resources for the last 2 months.
‚Ä¢ Pilots taking months not weeks to complete: As we‚Äôve started working with enterprise customers, the
time to complete pilots has increased from weeks to months. This is driven by a three factors:
a. Availability of customer stakeholders: Our pilots require engagement from customers to assess
results, provide feedback and iterate. With folks being OOO at the end of summer and priorities
changing it sometimes takes 2-3 weeks to get feedback on each iteration of a pilot. This means a
pilot that we originally intended to take 1 month takes 3.
b. Feature requests: Customers often have additional feature requests during pilots and we if we
believe they are going to be beneficial to other customers too we will build them. This can push
back iteration timelines.
c. Integrations: Working with larger customers, new integrations and API endpoints are often needed.
‚Ä¢ Customer annual planning cycle: A lot of the customers we wanted to secure pilots with are going
through annual planning this quarter, and can‚Äôt commit to pilots until they complete this, pushing out
pilots we wanted to do in Q4 to Q1 (e.g. Valley Bank, Paxos)
‚Ä¢ Enterprise sales cycles: We cover this in more depth below but to close 10 customers in Q4 we needed
to have started the sales process with ~100 companies 6-12 months ago. We simply didn‚Äôt have the
pipeline built up back then and even though we‚Äôre ramping up pipeline now, it will take a 6-12 months for
those customers to convert.

Next steps:
We prioritized all the customers, pilots and potential pilots based on priority by ARR, strategic importance
and urgency. Based on that we came up with the following prioritized goals to get us to $1M ARR:
1. Ensure Coinbase production rollout is successful. We have to get this right! ($500K ARR)
2. Hit success criteria for pilots currently live or going live this month to close ~$500K ARR in the following:
a. Coinbase: transaction alert open source investigation - $500K+
b. Pipe: Strategic to maintaining momentum with Alloy integration
c. Cashfree: $100K in ARR and close to meeting success criteria
d. Airwallex: Logo and expansion value
e. Mercury: up to $300K ARR plus logo value
f. Nium: Lower priority due to lack of urgency from them
g. Enable Finance: Lower priority due to low ARR
3. Finalize contracts for Coinbase and Flutterwave expansion
4. Secure $500K in additional pilots for December and early Q1.

December 2024
Subject: Parcha Investor Update November 2024
Parcha Investors,
The team has been heads down over the last month getting a second use case up and running with
Coinbase. This was originally planned to go into production in January but we were asked to pull in the
launch to December. As a result of being all hands on deck including AJ coding, we lost some momentum
on GTM this month.
Reminder: What Parcha does
We‚Äôre building an AI-powered compliance suite for fintechs and banks to accelerate their KYB/KYC manual
compliance reviews. Today there are three main use cases we are focused on:
1. Automated document validation: This is a big painpoint for B2B fintechs when onboarding businesses as
documents vary by jurisdiction and KYB processes. No existing vendors solve this well.
2. Business due diligence: B2B fintechs need to carry out extensive due diligence on their customers
including understanding what type of products the business sells, what industry it operates in, who the
business owners are, what their online presence is and much more. This is all done very manually today.
3. AML Screening: Over 90% of alerts from adverse media, sanctions, watchlist and PEP screening are
false positive. This creates a massive review overhead for fintechs both during onboarding at when
monitoring transactions. Parcha‚Äôs AI reduces false positives by 90%, speeding up the screening up the
screening process of individuals and businesses.
üëã Asks:
Help with hiring backend and applied AI engineer
We are ramping up a search for both a backend engineer and an Applied AI engineer with Python
experience. Their ideal profile is:
Backend Engineer:
‚Ä¢ 5++ years of experience scaling systems at fast-growing companies. Bonus if they‚Äôve done it in AI / ML
or other data-intensive applications.
‚ó¶ Deep Python expertise. Even better if they‚Äôve developed systems using async workflow execution
(e.g. Celery) or building workflows on systems like Prefect, Dagster, etc.
Applied AI Engineer:
‚Ä¢ Deep expertise in modern LLMs and their applications, ideally using them in production at scale.
Experience with LLM backtesting and a strong foundation in ML evaluation and testing.
For both roles:
‚Ä¢ Startup experience. Ideally, previous experience as founding engineer or early hire at at a startup.
‚Ä¢ Based in SF and excited to work in our office 5 days a week.
Customer intros:

We would love to speak to more fintech companies in our ICP: B2B Fintech experiencing strong growth that
are bottlenecked by KYB or KYC reviews. They don‚Äôt have to be US based or have US customers but their
business operating language needs to be english.
You can see latest list of target customers here. The ideal person to intro us to is the product or business
owner for onboarding not the head of compliance. Let us know if you can help with an intro and we will send
over a blurb.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Metrics
‚ó¶ ARR (booked + realized): ~$539,000
‚ó¶ Monthly Reviews: 1,174 (-7% - Coinbase still not in production)
‚ó¶ Active Pilots: ~$665,000 Forecasted (Pipe, EnableFinance, AirWallex, Cashfree, Nium, FIS Atelio,
Coinbase Transaction Alerts, Valley)
‚ó¶ Pilots in pipeline: ~$700K+ Forecasted (Mercury, Navebank, Paxos, Live Oak Bank, Worldpay)
‚ó¶ Demos Scheduled last month: 15
‚ó¶ Enterprise Pipeline: Visa, Mastercard, US Bank, Flex
‚Ä¢ Cash: $2,696,051
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$200K / ~14 months
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Scaled Coinbase to 60K reviews in December: The team pulled off an incredible feat scaling from
~1,000 reviews/month to over 60,000 reviews in December to help Coinbase clear their transaction alert
backlog. This required building multiple new features including batch processing, CSV downloads, batch
PDF exports, and significant infrastructure improvements. The team worked around the clock to support
this 50X scale increase.
‚Ä¢ Closed Airwallex as strategic customer: After a successful quarter-long POC focused on real-time
document verification, we closed Airwallex with an initial $15K contract. While the initial contract is
modest, this is a strategic win given their brand recognition and significant expansion potential as we
become an established vendor.
‚Ä¢ Strong Q1 pilot pipeline: We've secured pilots with several significant players including WorldPay,
Paxos, Flex, Skyline, Prelim, Mercury, LiveOak and notably 3 banks including Valley Bank ($60B+ in
assets). These represent over $500K in potential value and importantly validate our expansion beyond
pure fintech into banking.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Missed $1M ARR goal: Several factors contributed to missing our 2024 ARR target:
‚ó¶ Key deals delayed by holidays (Flutterwave, Pipe, Enable Finance)
‚ó¶ Coinbase prioritizing backlog remediation over contract expansion. We‚Äôre now working with them to
finalize the expansion, pending the completion of some additional model governance requirements.
‚ó¶ Two pilot disengagements (Cashfree, Nium) due to insufficient urgency qualification
‚ó¶ Over-reliance on Coinbase expansion for hitting our number

‚Ä¢ $45K loss on December Coinbase processing: A data ingestion pipeline issue affected 44% of reviews
(16,567 cases), requiring us to rerun cases at no charge. While Coinbase appreciated our transparency
and quick response, this wiped out our margins on the $130K of processing.
What we learned:
‚ó¶ Need for more rigorous production testing (implementing mandatory 100-case validation period)
‚ó¶ More investment in observability metrics and tooling
‚ó¶ Stricter code review requirements even for customer-specific branches
‚ó¶ Planning to hire dedicated QA specialist in Q1
‚Ä¢ Pricing model needs work: The Coinbase incident highlighted weaknesses in our pricing model:
‚ó¶ Current pricing doesn't adequately account for complexity and risk.
‚ó¶ Need better margins up front. We optimized the first Coinbase use case to higher margins (70-80%)
but didn‚Äôt have time to optimize models for the second one, resulting in losses.
‚ó¶ Looking at ways to differentiate pricing platform vs. usage.
üéØ Key Focus Areas for Q1:
‚Ä¢ Implementing more robust testing and monitoring.
‚Ä¢ Diversifying revenue with more medium-sized accounts (~$100K)
‚Ä¢ Developing scalable process for smaller accounts (~$20K) without custom pilots
‚Ä¢ Building stronger deal qualification and closing playbook
‚Ä¢ Considering first sales hire to help scale beyond tech-focused founder salesGoals
Nov 2024 Lookback
Goal Status Look back

June 23'
Parcha Investors,
With our pre-seed round complete and our first full month operating under our belt, we thought it was a
great opportunity to share our first investor update. In May we got clarity on the product we‚Äôre building: AI
agents to supercharge compliance and operations, we built a proof of concept that we were able to demo
to potential design partners and closed our pre-seed funding round.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Design Partners Engaged: 0/5 (1 in scoping stage, 2 in consideration stage, 6 in demo stage)
‚Ä¢ Cash: $2,200,000 (+$225K allocated not yet funded)
‚Ä¢ Burn rate/Runway: $82K/~2.5yrs
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Product Clarity: In late April when we started the fundraising process we were exploring building a
copilot for knowledge workers to become instant experts at their job using AI. Thanks to many
discussions, customer interviews, prototypes and advances in AI, we now have very high conviction on
the product we‚Äôre building: We're building AI agents that automate fintech compliance and operations
workflows, addressing a pressing need for cost-efficient scaling. Our platform makes it easy for non-
technical teams to create AI agents using relevant knowledge and instructions, and integrates
seamlessly with existing tools. Parcha's AI agents cost a fraction of hiring human experts for the same
task.
‚Ä¢ Working proof of concept: This months we successfully built a working proof of concept of our AI
agents completing a compliance workflows so we could demo to potential design partners.
In the proof of concept (see Loom demo) our agent is able to learn how to carry out a periodic
compliance review by simply reading a Google doc. Then, When requested by the user, the agent is
then able to complete the 3 step periodic review process for a real company, using tools like MidDesk,
Pitchbook and Google Maps Platform to verify information, completely autonomously and without any
prior further training or hard coded instructions.
This demo was a huge lift for the team and when we got the agent working for the first time we felt an
immediate sense of the excitement about the opportunity in front of us at Parcha.
‚Ä¢ Design partner interest: Demos with design partners have been going really well so far. We‚Äôre scoping a
POC with Brex, are working out pricing with Meow, and are in conversations with a BaaS provider, a
crypto exchange and a traditional bank.
‚Ä¢ Funding secured: We closed $2.5M in pre-seed! Thank you all for choosing to back us on this journey
and huge shoutout to Steve and Kanyi @ Kindred Ventures for leading our round.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Burn rate: Our May burn rate was higher than expected at $82K. We hired 5 contractors across Eng,
applied AI and Design to speed up building our proof of concept for demoes. We're ramping down
contractors in June in favor of full-time hires to be more capital efficient. Of the 5 contractors, we‚Äôre
bringing on one as a full-time engineer and continuing with one as a part-time designer. As a follow-up

we need to update our financials with a new headcount plan for the next year given that our focus is
now on building an enterprise-grade product.
‚Ä¢ Hiring: We had a goal of having offers out to one Jr eng, one Sr eng and a pipeline for an Applied AI eng
by end of month but given the focus on starting with contractors to kickstart development, we only
made progress on hiring a mid-level engineer. We need to ramp up engineering hiring in June and with
the highest priority hire being an applied AI engineer to replace our part-time contractor.
  Asks:
Design Partner intros: We would love your help with introductions to growth-stage (Series C+) fintech
companies in your portfolio with established compliance and ops teams but a need to increase cost
efficiency. Our buyer at these companies is usually the Head of Ops or GM that owns the cost of
implementing compliance.
Here‚Äôs a blurb you can forward:
At Parcha, we‚Äôre building expert AI agents to supercharge fintech companies, starting with compliance and
operations. AJ and Miguel previously led the platform team at Brex's where we grew the customer base 10X
in just a year by making onboarding, compliance, risk management and underwriting more automated.
Despite 200+ people working on this problem there were still many workflows that required humans in the
loop which became a bottleneck growth. We know Brex isn‚Äôt unique in dealing with these manual workflows
and we believe AI can help.
We‚Äôre building an enterprise-grade platform that makes it really easy for non-technical teams to quickly
create AI agents to complete repetitive manual tasks, simply by seeding the agent with relevant knowledge
and instructions e.g. by providing a procedures doc for completing customer due diligence. We‚Äôre designing
Parcha to integrate seamlessly with the tools your teams already use and be deployed into your existing
cloud infrastructure so your data is always secure. Parcha‚Äôs AI agents can instantly be scaled up and down,
are easy to audit and will cost a fraction of how much it would cost to hire or ramp up an expert to complete
the same task.
At this stage we‚Äôre engaging with 5 early design partners to help us shape the platform and have 2
remaining slots
üéØ Goals for this month
Our primary goal for June is to be engaged with one design partner that we‚Äôre building a POC for.
Goal Context
1 design partner officially engaged on a POC We want to validate that we can deploy an AI

July 23'
Parcha Investors,
Happy 4th of July! In June we started our first POC with Bridge.xyz and now have almost 20 opportunities
in our design partner pipeline. We also hired John Baunach as our Founding Designer and had over 50
interviews with candidates for our Applied AI Eng role with our first candidate doing a work trial with us next
week.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Design Partners Engaged: 1/5
‚Ä¢ Cash: $2,273,660
‚Ä¢ Burn rate/Runway: ~$105K/~22 months (Books closing on 7/7/)
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ First Design Partner: In June we started working with out first design partner Bridge.xyz, an early stage
crypto company provide stablecoin APIs. Today the Bridge team (including Eng) spend hours every
week manually reviewing businesses that are onboarded by their developer customers. We‚Äôre creating
our first production agent for the Bridge team to carry out reviews much faster and eventually remove
this burden from the team altogether. We plan to ship Agent 001 to by mid-July and transition Bridge to
a fully automated system in August.
‚Ä¢ Agent 001: We migrated to our own AI Agent architecture outside of Langchain. Our POC Langchain-
based agent helped us to kick off development and prepare demos, but it made development difficult
since we had less control of the underlying code and couldn‚Äôt make changes easily without forking
Langchain. Agent 001 is simpler to build on top of, it has support for audit trails, benchmarking, and it
gives us the flexibility to compose multiple agents to perform very complex tasks.
‚Ä¢ Building up design partner pipeline: Thanks to many of you for introductions to potential design
partners! We now have almost 20 opportunities in our pipeline and with every conversation we‚Äôre
learning more about who our ideal customer is. We‚Äôre seeing for example that manual reviews far more
of an issue with B2B than B2C fintechs and urgency is more apparent at companies that are hyper
focused on profitability. Our goal is to have 4 more design partners engaged by September and we‚Äôre
now focusing on earlier stage fintechs, not just growth stage (see lowlights).
‚Ä¢ Hired Founding Designer: We‚Äôre excited to share that John Baunach has joined us as our Founding
Designer. John brings to the team experience in enterprise from his time as as Sr Director of Design at
Salesforce and led product and design at Offsitely and Torch. What we love most about John is that he
is still a builder at heart and has a scrappy founder mentality. Fun fact: John and AJ were in the same YC
class in 2008. Here‚Äôs an awesome product video John designed for us in the first 5 days we worked
together that‚Äôs going to be the headline of our website.
‚Ä¢ Applied AI pipeline: We‚Äôve had over 50 interviews with candidates for our Applied AI role and have one
candidate who we‚Äôre really excited about doing a work trial with us on July 10, with a 3-4 more strong
candidates standing by too.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Burn rate: Our burn rate increased this month despite our goal of ramping down contractors. Here‚Äôs
why:

‚ó¶ Contractor paid in arrears: When we closed out one of our contractors, we owed them for work in
April. ‚Üí By end of this week we will have ended all contracts outside of work trials.
‚ó¶ One-time expenses: Deposit for our SF office, website, SOC-2 compliance assessment,
bookkeeping setup and catch-up.
‚ó¶ Work trials: We did paid work trials with a couple of candidates for engineering and design roles. The
design one worked out (John) but the engineering one did not. ‚Üí Moving forward we‚Äôre shortening
trials from 2 weeks to 1 and reducing the hourly rate
‚Ä¢ Enterprise sales pace: The time to get from initial intro to starting to scope a POC for growth stage
fintechs has been 4-6 weeks which is much longer than we anticipated. This makes it harder for us to
get feedback and iterate, which is why we‚Äôre so eager to work with Bridge as they could move much
faster. ‚Üí This month we‚Äôre pivoting our design partner strategy to focus on earlier stage startups like
Bridge for the next few months. In addition we‚Äôve enlisted the help of Joelle Kaufman, an experience
GTM leader to coach us on sales.
üí∏ Finance / Fundraising
This month we created a financial plan, based on our hiring needs and have a better understanding of what
our steady state burn will look like (~$125K/month ) once we have finished hiring our seed stage team.
Based on this we are considering extending our pre-seed into a seed round so we have 2+ years of runway
with enough capital to grow the team further once we start seeing traction. At the same time, we don‚Äôt want
fundraising to distract from our goal of signing up Design Partners so we're still deciding timing on this.
  Asks
Design Partner intros: We would love your help with introductions to early stage fintechs with PMF who
have recently hit an inflection point in their growth. Working with these startups will allow us to move faster
and get critical feedback as we deploy our agents into production as the buyer, decider and user are often
the same person. Our ICP at these companies is their compliance or ops leader.
Here‚Äôs an email you can share:
I‚Äôd like to introduce you to AJ Asver, Founder of Parcha.ai. Parcha is making onboarding, compliance, risk
management and underwriting more automated using AI. AJ asked to meet with you to learn more about
how you are scaling operations and explore if Parcha could help you scale more efficiently. AJ and his co-
founder Miguel, grew Brex‚Äôs customer base 10x in a year and were motivated to start Parcha because of the
significant bottlenecks they encountered that were created by manual workflows requiring humans in the
loop. They‚Äôre only working with 5 early partners and there are 2 openings left.

Parcha Investors,
Last month we shipped our first AI Agent to Bridge.xyz, started 2 more Design partnerships with Tenet and
Brex and closed an additional $2.5M in seed funding from Initialized Capital. We didn‚Äôt however make
progress on hiring our first engineer, and still have a lot of work to do for SOC 2.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Design Partners Engaged: 3/5 (4 more in scoping stage)
‚Ä¢ Cash: $4.7M
‚Ä¢ Burn rate/Runway: ~$127K/~3yrs
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Shipped first AI Agent: We shipped Agent 001 to Bridge last month to automate their KYB review
process. This was a big milestone for the team as it‚Äôs our first POC production agent which was also
uses a multi agent architecture with a supervisor agent co-ordinating multiple worker agents to carry
out parts of Bridges SOP, a fully composable architecture. We still have a lot of iterating and testing to
do with Bridge and hit an issue with our Chrome extension that we‚Äôre working to solve (see lowlights).
‚Ä¢ Two more design partners: Last month we started design partnership with two more companies:
‚ó¶ Brex who we‚Äôre excited to partner with across multiple workflows. We‚Äôre going to start with
automating their Merchant Categorization process which is currently done with a combination of
ML, mechanical turk and a BPO team. We‚Äôre also scoping an agent to support their Periodic Review
process including communicating with customers!
‚ó¶ Tenet is a climate startup that provides EV loans that will be using Parcha to help automating their
income verification process for new auto loans.
‚Ä¢ Building in-person: We brought the team together in our SF office for a week to sprint on Agent 001
and it gave us conviction that at this stage we want to have a fully in-person team, which means we will
be hiring exclusively in the SF Bay Area in moving forward.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Hiring progress: We missed our goal of onboarding an Applied AI engineer last month. As we went
through the work trial process with two candidates, it became clearer to us that hiring a specialist
Applied AI eng isn‚Äôt the right move. The candidates that we trialed couldn‚Äôt easily move to other parts of
the stack when needed and didn‚Äôt operate autonomously enough. On the other hand Miguel and I have
been able to learn Applied AI quickly, which means a strong full stack engineer should be able to learn it
too. Starting this month we‚Äôre going to focus hiring efforts on finding a really strong and experienced full
stack founding engineer and working with a former Brex eng recruiter to speed up this process.
‚Ä¢ Chrome extension: We wanted to ship Parcha as an unpacked Chrome extension but realized this can
get blocked by security policies, as was the case with Eric at Bridge. We‚Äôre now in the process of getting
approval from the Chrome app store for an official extension pending our Privacy Policy being drafted,
which we‚Äôre working with our counsel on.
‚Ä¢ SOC 2 progress: We wanted to resolve all the SOC 2 requirements last month so we could start the
observation period but we decided to deprioritize this workstream over shipping our first agent to
Bridge. We‚Äôve started working on this and plan to get it done this month.

üí∏ Finance / Fundraising
‚Ä¢ $2.5M seed funding: We‚Äôre excited to share that we closed a $2.5M seed round at a $25M valuation
with Initialized Capital, working with Managing Partner Brett Gibson. We‚Äôre really excited to be
partnering with Initialized and especially Brett who first invested as an angel in our pre-seed! We‚Äôve now
closed $5M in total funding which gives us ample runway to go heads down and build for the next
year+.

Parcha Investors,
Last month, we made our first engineering hire, are hit our goal of engaging with 5 design partners by
September. At the same time we hit accuracy and reliability challenges with our agents that prevented us
from shipping to customers but we now a plan to improve this over the next couple of weeks. We‚Äôve
decided to switch to paying customers as our north star metric moving forward so we‚Äôre focused on
providing tangible value.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Paying customers: 0
‚Ä¢ Design Partners Engaged: 5/5 by September
‚Ä¢ Cash: $4,957,841.00(+$360K from Kindred Pro-rata)
‚Ä¢ Burn rate/Runway: ~$100K/~4yrs
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Hired first engineer: We‚Äôre excited to share that Dmytro Kovalchuk is joining the team as our first
engineering hire. Dmytro has a 20+ yrs of full-stack engineering experience with the last 5 years more
focused on ML engineering and most recently applied AI at Carvana. His experience using LLMs to
process documents at Carvana is going to make him invaluable to improving our agents when he joins.
In addition on Dmytro we have 3 more strong candidates that are at final interview stages so we feel
pretty confident we will close at least one more engineer in September.
‚Ä¢ 5 Design partners: We set an ambitious goal of having 5 design partners engaged by September and
we‚Äôre happy to share that we hit this milestone last month. We‚Äôre now in the process of testing, building
or scoping agents for Bridge, Brex, Tenet, Yiftee and one more growth stage fintech.
‚Ä¢ Public launch: We announced our seed fundraise along with launching our website last month via this
great article in Fortune and got lots of inbound customer requests as a result. It‚Äôs clear that demand
exists for what we‚Äôre building and our approach to reducing manual reviews really seems to resonate.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Agent accuracy and reliability: As we started testing Bridge and Tenet‚Äôs agents we hit a number of
accuracy and reliability issues which slowed down rollout. In particular we need to make improvements
to accuracy of document extraction and how well agents pass data from one step in an SOP to the next.
We‚Äôre pausing all out-bounding and onboarding new design partners until we solve this in September so
AJ can focus more time on coding too. We have to get 5 agents working in production with customers
that love the product and are willing to pay before we scale further.
‚Ä¢ Chrome Extension set backs: We initially built our product as a Chrome extension so operators can use
it alongside their existing case management system. This was always supposed to be a stop-gap UX
until we had our own admin experience but the extension has created a number of challenges including
issues with websockets, getting rejected from the Chrome webstore and making security more
complex. We decided last week to scrap the extension in favor of a web-based experience with a queue
of incoming tasks for an agent to complete that is loaded via API requests to our customers case
management tools. This will simplify the product and allow us to fully focus engineering efforts on the
improving the agent.
‚Ä¢ SOC 2 tests not yet complete: We got 90% of the checks and tests completed for SOC 2 but still need
to carry out a pen-test which we‚Äôre prioritizing this month.

We have to mention the infra / platform work we did to ensure agents run outside of the API path and migrating out of the websockets
dependency. Seems small / too technical, but this will enable us to run multiple agents in parallel, persist their run / history, enable
agent‚Äôs triggering through an API, webhooks, audit trails, etc. We were not planning to do this in August, but decided it ws the right to
do after the reliability issues in prod.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update October 2023: From 1 to 10
Parcha Investors,
Last month, we made a lot of progress on agent development with Agent 002, a new iteration of our AI
agent that is more accurate and reliable than 001. We feel much more confident giving this agent to our
customers and it in testing with both Bridge and Tenet and we now see a clear path to getting to scaling to
10 agents. At the same time we fell short of the goals we set for the month, which we provided a
retrospective of in our lowlights section.
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Paying customers: 0/10
‚Ä¢ Time To Build an Agent: ~4 weeks (context below)
‚Ä¢ Cash: $4,890,024
‚Ä¢ Burn rate / Runway: ~$100K/~yrs
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ Agent 002: Going into September we weren‚Äôt happy with the accuracy and reliability of our agents and
made improving this our # 1 priority. Agent 002 is the outcome of both of us going heads down in
September to solve this problem. We improved accuracy by making our integrations more consistent
which then allowed us to benchmark and improving prompts and model selection. We improved
reasoning by implementing memory in the agent and enabling it to run a sequence of tools
deterministically. Finally we improved reliability by enabling self correction: the ability for the agent to
course correct when it has errors without human intervention. Based on customer feedback, we also
implemented a web interface for our agent with the ability to queue and run jobs asynchronously. .
‚Ä¢ Path to 10 Agents: Another outcome of sprinting on the Agent002 is that we now have a much better
sense of how to scale from building one or two agents to building 10++ agents. We need to transform
ourselves from custom hand-building cars to building a car assembly line.
Here‚Äôs how we will do it...
‚ó¶ Components: Instead of building agents with custom components, we‚Äôre going to focus on creating
reusable components that will make new agents much faster to assemble, in a matter of days not
weeks. This means we can take a workflow with multiple steps, say KYB or researching a company
on web, and use these workflows in many different agents.
‚ó¶ Assemblies: With Agent 002 we‚Äôve made it much easier to assemble these components together
and reuse the assemblies. This allows us to create a core set of well tuned workflows that agents
can use that are not tightly coupled to the use case the agent is built for. The first of these are Data
Extraction, Data Verification and Data Calculation.
‚ó¶ Simplification and reusability: We‚Äôre going to push harder to simplify customer requirements for the
first agent they pay for so we can reduce development time and reuse as many components /
assemblies as possible.
We start tracking progress on our path to building this agent factory with a new metric: Time To Build an
Agent. This is the average time it takes to build an agent from SOP provided by customer to production-
ready for customers to test. We need to get this number down from weeks to hours.
‚Ä¢ Closed 1 more hire: We just closed Jonathan Johanneman as a new engineering hire that will be joining
us later this month. Jonathan has a background in ML and Data Science and is joining us to work on

Applied AI.
üëé Lowlights:
We missed all 4 of our monthly goals in October. Here‚Äôs what happened:
‚Ä¢ Reach 90% accuracy when benchmarked against back test data: While we‚Äôre confident from empirical
evidence that Agent002 is more accurate that its predecessor, we underestimated the investment that
would be needed to do build out an end-to-end benchmarking suite to perform formal evaluations.
‚Ä¢ SOC 2 observation period started: We completed the first round of pen-testing but didn‚Äôt factor in time
for remediations. We should have acted with more urgency earlier in the month to achieve this goal but
prioritized building Agent 002 instead of completing what felt like a chore.
‚Ä¢ 2 Paying customers: We went through a few iterations on pricing with customer feedback before we
were ready to get MSAs and order forms signed, and then underestimated the time it would take to
close them.
‚Ä¢ Hire 2 more engineers: We made 3 offers in total last month. We closed one; one candidate reneged
after signing and getting a competitive offer from their current employer; one candidate chose a
competing offer with much higher cash compensation at a more mature company.
Here‚Äôs what we learned:
‚Ä¢ Input vs output metrics: We focused way too much on output metrics when setting our goals last
month without thinking hard enough about the inputs we need to get there. While hitting 90% accuracy
and getting 2 paying customers are important, the input was improving our agent such that we could
get it into the hands of our customers to test, and that‚Äôs where we actually spent all our efforts. The
same is true for hiring where got multiple candidates to the offer stage and improved our pipelines.
We‚Äôre going to focus more on input metrics in our monthly goals moving forward.
‚Ä¢ Unknown unknowns: We were about 2X off our estimates on how much work was needed to improve
accuracy/reliability of our agents. We need to be more mindful that we‚Äôre in unchartered territory with AI
Agents and that we‚Äôre going to discover issues as we go.
‚Ä¢ Acting with urgency: With both of us deep in coding we didn‚Äôt prioritize moving the ball forward on
mission critical chores like SOC-2 until later in the month. Moving forward we‚Äôre going to get chores
done first by front-loading them to in the week/month. Similarly we need to move faster when the ball is
in our court on GTM with things like pricing and contract negotiations and we need push our customers
to move faster too.
‚Ä¢ Accountability: As we onboard more team members its really important that we create a culture of
hitting the goals we set. That starts with two of us having clear ownership of monthly goals and hold
each other accountable every day.
‚Ä¢ Relationship building for hiring: Every hire we‚Äôve closed so far has been through an existing relationship
or referral from someone in our network. These opportunistic hires have been stronger candidates that
are more likely to convert and don‚Äôt cost us more to hire. We‚Äôre going to be investing more in building
relationships more opportunistically for future hires going forward. Please intro us to awesome
engineers in your network, even if they aren‚Äôt actively looking right now.

November 23'
Subject: Parcha Investor Update November 2023: Focusing on KYB
Parcha Investors,
Last week we made an important strategic decision: We‚Äôre going focus on KYB automation in the near
term and build a product end-to-end for this use-case. We‚Äôve considered the pros and cons on focusing
on one use case in the past and this month it became very clear to us that it‚Äôs the best path forward if we
want to reduce time to value for our customers, make our agents more robust and reliable and exponentially
grow the business.
Our previous strategy of building many different types of use agents was pulling us in lots of directions, with
different customers and made it hard to compound the value of each agent as the lego blocks to build them
were all so different. Focusing on KYB, we‚Äôre going to spend the next 8 weeks sprinting to build an end-to-
end KYB manual review automation product around the KYB agent we built for Bridge.
Our goal by December is for Bridge to be using this product in production at scale with API, dashboard,
metrics and customer outreach (their biggest feature request) as part of the solution. This product will be
easily customizable for new customers without all the implementation work that needs to be done today,
bringing time to value from weeks to hours. By focusing on KYB our value prop is clear to customers:
reduce cost and increase conversion.
We had two design partners, Yiftee (giftcard fraud reviews) and Tenet (EV load income verification) that
didn‚Äôt fit this use case and we shutting down development for. With all the remaining design partners (Brex,
Bancoli, Flutterwave and Keep) we will be focused on a KYB or KYB adjacent use case (e.g. company due
diligence, industry categorization, periodic reviews).
We firmly believe this approach will set Parcha up to scale quickly in 2024 and once we‚Äôve nailed the KYB
use-case we can then expand to other use cases.

We have one more hire to close for our founding team, a rock star senior full stack engineer, and we need
you help finding this person.
Please could you introduce us to any experienced (5+ yrs) full stack engineers you know that could be a
good fit for Parcha. Here‚Äôs a our JD and description of the role you can forward:

Parcha is hiring a founding full-stack engineer to help us scale our AI agents to dozens and then hundreds
of enterprise customers. This is an opportunity to work with a very experienced founding team of product/
eng/design leaders from Brex, Coinbase, Google, Twitter and Salesforce. They are working at the cutting
edge of AI Agents for a real-world use case: instantly automating compliance and operations workflows in
enterprise companies, starting with Fintech. They have a big vision too: To become the AWS for digital AI
employees.
Parcha has raised $5M in seed funding and already has a pipeline of dozens of enterprise customers. They
are looking for an experienced (5+ yrs) full stack engineer who can work across the stack (Python and
Typescript experience), has led complex projects with autonomy and is excited to work in-person in an early
stage company in San Francisco.
Design Partner intros:
We would love to speak to more fintech companies who have recently hit an inflection point in their growth
and are experiencing compliance/ops bottlenecks in their onboarding process. Our ICP at these companies
is their compliance or ops leader.
Here‚Äôs an email you can send:
I‚Äôd like to introduce you to AJ Asver, Co-Founder of Parcha.ai. AJ and his co-founder Miguel, grew Brex‚Äôs
customer base 10x in a year and were motivated to start Parcha because of the bottlenecks they saw in
customer growth caused by manual compliance workflows requiring humans in the loop. Their product
automates KYB manual review processes using AI speed up onboarding and reduce operational costs. AJ
would like to learn more about how you are scaling your compliance processes today and explore if Parcha
could help.

3 agents working production with real Missed We weren‚Äôt able to get 3 agents with 3
customer usage: Bridge, Tenet and Yiftee. different use cases in production
successfully. We made the hard decision at
the end of the month that we need to focus
on nailing one use case really well first: KYB.
POC of web research agent that will be used Done We have a POC of a web research agent that
by 3+ customers. we‚Äôre now using as the foundation for doing
due diligence on a business. We‚Äôre going to
be tuning this agent for two different use
cases: Merchant Categorization and KYB
diligence.
Remediate pen-testing issues. Done We remediated all issues and are now in the
audit phase of SOC-2!
3 on-sites for full stack engineer. Done 3 on-sites. 1 candidate passed on us and 2
we passed on. We will be pausing
outbounding in Nov as we focus on KYB but
would still appreciate intros.
üéØ Nov Goals

Goal Context
Build a KYB specific agent that can be used by As we‚Äôre now focused on KYB we are going to update our
multiple customers (Bridge and Bancoli to start) agent so that it can be customized to each customer
without code changes.
Enable Bridge to use the KYB agent end-to-end for Bridge‚Äôs ideal use case is that we not only complete the
manual review and follow-up customer comms for manual review but also communicate with customers to
all incoming KYBs request and review additional documentation. This
requires integrating via API both for triggering reviews and
returning the response.

Subject: Parcha Investor Update November 2023: Season‚Äôs Greetings!
Parcha Investors,
Last month we successfully pivoted our technology and team to be focused on end-to-end KYB review
automation and signed up our first two paying customers. This month we‚Äôre working hard to get our second
customer Bancoli into testing and production
üìà Key Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Paying customers: 2/10
‚Ä¢ Time To Build an Agent: ~2 weeks
‚Ä¢ Cash: $4,671,871
‚Ä¢ Net Burn Rate / Runway: ~$120K/~3.5yrs
üëç Highlights:
‚Ä¢ KYB agent working end-to-end: We ended last month with a KYB agent that can review a case across
all the necessary checks for onboarding a business. By focusing on one agent we were able to go deep
into the workflow and automate more of the steps. The new KYB agent can now do the following:
‚ó¶ Open source due diligence on a business via internet searching
‚ó¶ Industry and country categorization and verification against customer‚Äôs high risk list
‚ó¶ Sanctions, watchlist and PEP screening with false-positive detection (very common issue)
‚ó¶ Incorporation document verification in multiple languages
‚ó¶ Business ownership extraction from documents (e.g. entities with >25% ownership)
‚ó¶ Tax ID verification for US businesses
‚ó¶ KYC verification to make sure government ID matches documented owners of business
We‚Äôre now working hard on tuning all these checks to make it more accurate. You can see a short demo
of the new agent from Dmytro here.
‚Ä¢ +2 paying customers: We simplified our pricing to be purely usage based and signed both Bridge and
Bancoli as paying customers on annual contracts. Here‚Äôs our new design partner deck.
üëé Lowlights:
‚Ä¢ Still not processing all Bridge KYBs: We didn‚Äôt hit our goal of processing all KYB reviews for Bridge this
month. Parcha is integrated into the Bridge‚Äôs case management system for running KYB reviews on
demand as a starting point until they are ready to integrate directly with our API.
