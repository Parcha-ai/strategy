Launched Agent Hub → more companies trying Parcha
Since launching Agent Hub 2 weeks ago we’ve had 22 companies try Parcha, more than the total pilots we’ve ever run to date.
We’ve also been able to use Agent Hub to quickly move customers from a demo into the product so they can test it out
themselves. This is a huge win for accelerating our funnel with smaller and mid-size companies and speed up partnership
opportunities too. A few highlights include Stablesea (series A crypto), Veriff (interested in using Parcha for KYB both internally
and as partner), and UI Path (want to use us for vendor risk and customer onboarding)
Partnership traction
We’ve had multiple referrals from Alloy in the last quarter and deals that we favored in because of our Alloy intergration. These
include IG, Flagstone and Worldpay. We’re also seeing customer interest from other compliance/risk vendors like Veriff,
Sumsub, and TRM Labs, with whom we are in active conversations. In addition, we’re partnering with FSVector (fintech
compliance advisor) to support their clients.
Hired Ji Su Hiatt to backfill for John Baunach as Head of Design
JB is leaving for personal / family reasons at the end of this month after 2 yrs as our designer. Ji Su is joining us from NMI
where she transformed their design process from Figma to Cursor. She’s all in on “vibe designing” and comes with a wealth of
experience in both B2B and Fintech. We’re really excited for her to be joining the team in person in SF starting in mid-august.
Winning bakeoffs
We won a AML screening bakeoff against Greenlite with customer IG.com (FTSE 250 brokerage) who highlighted that our AI
was more accurate (9/10 vs 4/10) and our product experience was better. We also won a bakeoff against a legacy vendor for
MCC categorization for Worldpay who liked our API based approach and lack of human in the loop.

Coinbase expansion paused
We thougth we were at the final stages with the $1.5M Coinbase expansion but we were wrong - the expansion is now paused,
driven by a couple of reasons:
• Data breach changed priorities: The recent data breach shifted priorities across the team we worked with and as a result,
our use case was deprioritized.
• Requirements changed last minute: We were blindsided by a last minute change in requirements because their compliance
and product teams were not aligned. As a result, the head of customer support who owns the budget. wasn’t willing to sign
until we delivered 5 additional requirements that weren’t discussed prior.
This gives us more conviction that we can’t have a lot of our revenue concentrated in a small number of enterprise accounts
where we have little leverage. As next steps for this deal we’re requiring a $100K implementation fee and requirements signed
off in a contract to force Coinbase to commit to the expansion. They are now revising requirements but we don’t expect any
material movement on this deal in Q3.
We only closed 1 new deal in Q2
Despite having multiple pilots in progress in Q2 we only closed one deal - IG.
Here’s what we observed:
Bottom of funnel:
• Lack of urgency: IG had a clear need and urgency driving them to push for a pilot to be done quickly but most of the other
prospects at the pilot phase lacked that same urgency e.g. Worldpay went through multiple successful pilots but we’re still
in the vendor due diligence phase for first use case.
• Changing priorities: Mercury, Synctera and Flex started pilots with us which stalled due to priorities changing internally.
Flex is back on track but Mercury and Synctera are in limbo.
• Lack of compliance buy-in: We went through a lengthy pilot process with Paxos, and then at the point of signing a
contract, they pulled out due to lack of buy-in from compliance on a very low deal size ($10K). We also had multiple PMs
leave during the pilot which meant we never had a continous champion.
Middle of funnel:
• Lack of urgency: We completed 50+ demos in Q3 but none lead to pilots in the quarter. Despite initial interest in Parcha, we
didn’t see that convert into setting up pilots.
• Lack of engagement: We would often follow-up with customers 5-10 times and not receive any response.
Top of funnel
• Lack of responses: Our head of revenue ran an account-focused campaign to 40 fintechs reaching out to almost 400
people in different roles across email and Linkedin. We weren’t able to convert a single outbound into a demo.
Here are our hypotheses as to what’s going wrong:

1. The market may not be ready yet: It’s possible that we were lucky with a few enterprise customers, but most compliance
officers are not ready to actually adopt AI yet. This doesn’t however explain how Greenlite our main competitor is rumored
to have $10M in CARR when they raised their series A in May.
2. We need to do a better job of getting compliance buy-in earlier: The long integration path prior to Parcha 2.0 meant
compliance was bought in later when they could finally review the pilot outputs. We need to get them using the product
earlier. We always viewed product/eng as the champion/driver and Compliance as the approver. In reality
compliance/operations is the economic buyer so we have to get them onboard to close any deal.
3. Compliance is not a high enough priority: Improving compliance efficiency is just not as high a priority as driving growth.
This is by far the most concerning reason as it’s largely out of our control.
The combination of all 3 of these issues has convinced us that we need to expand beyond AML compliance and take a
different approach to selling to the compliance market.
Make or break moment for Parcha
Without the Coinbase expansion contract closed, we are not in a position to raise a series A at just ~$1M in ARR. Coinbase
already accounts for >50% of revenue this year, they haven’t met their minimum yet and their contract renews in November.
Between now and November, we need to maximize the likelihood of Coinbase expanding and renewing, but operate with the
assumption they may not, given how difficult they have been to work with. That leaves us in a precarious position for
fundraising, especially with little growth in the last quarter and ~9 months of runway by November.
We feel compelled to make drastic changes if we want the company to succeed:
• Cut burn from ~$250K to $175K to extend runway
• Move all infra to Northflank to reduce compute resources
• Freeze all hiring (now AJ, Miguel, 2 Eng, 1 designer FTEs plus 2 contractors)
• Start running rapid experiments to test demand in adjacent verticals

🔍 Problem Statement
We exited Q2 with stalled growth, uncertain enterprise expansion, and no clear path to Series A metrics.
• Coinbase’s $1.5M expansion was paused, due to shifting priorities after a security breach and misaligned internal
requirements.
• We closed just one net-new deal (IG) despite 50+ demos and several pilots.
• 50% of ARR remains tied to a single customer, and total usage plateaued at ~25K reviews/month.
• Compliance—the true buyer—is risk-averse, slow to act, and demands high trust early, yet we have historically engaged
them too late.
• At our prior burn of ~$250K/month, we had ~12 months of runway — but with flat growth, we would drop to ~9 months by
the end of Q3.
🎯 Q3 Goals
1. Double usage to ≥ 50K reviews/month
2. Diversify volume across customers and use cases
3. Rebuild trust with Compliance buyers
4. Reduce burn to $175K/month and extend runway to ~15 months
5. Prove Agent Hub as a scalable PLG channel by hitting 50 activated workspaces and 5K monthly reviews from start-ups
💡 Strategy Overview
We will execute a three-part strategy to grow faster, diversify smarter, and operate leaner:

Pillar Objective What We’ll Do Target Impact

2. Go BROAD with Prove demand in • Launch 3 startup-focused +5K reviews/month
Agent Hub fast-moving adjacent experiments:• Vendor Due Diligence (Aug from ≥ 30 activated
use cases 12)• Real-Estate AML (Aug 26)• Agent Hub signups

Each test must generate ≥ 5 signups in
30 days to continue
3. Cut burn & extend Reach sustainability • Pause hiring and backfills• Cut founder Burn ↓ from $250K

🧭 Board-Level Questions
1. Dual-track vs deep-only:
2. Are we aligned on continuing 3 Agent Hub experiments in parallel with Compliance trust work (≤ 20% GTM bandwidth), or
should we pause experiments to focus fully on enterprise?
3. PLG experiment gate:
4. Is ≥ 5 new Agent Hub signups in 30 days a strong enough success threshold? Should we tighten, loosen, or layer on
revenue or usage metrics?
5. Next trust credential:
6. After the Compliance Trust Bundle, should we fund ISO 27001 prep now, or wait for explicit customer demand?
