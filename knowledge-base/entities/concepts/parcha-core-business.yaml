  ## Overview
  Parcha accelerates compliance with AI agents â€” handling due diligence, AML screening, and document verification. Fintechs and banks use the platform to reduce onboarding time and boost operational efficiency without increasing risk.
  
  ## Core Use Cases
  
  ### 1. Automated Document Validation
  - **Problem**: Documents vary by jurisdiction and KYB processes
  - **Solution**: AI-powered validation across multiple document types
  - **Differentiation**: No existing vendors solve this well
  - **Target**: B2B fintechs onboarding businesses
  
  ### 2. Business and Individual Due Diligence
  - **Business Due Diligence (KYB)**:
    - Product/service analysis
    - Industry classification
    - Ownership structure verification
    - Online presence validation
  - **Individual Due Diligence (KYC)**:
    - Source of funds verification
    - Criminal background checks
    - Geographical location verification
  - **Current State**: Done very manually today
  
  ### 3. AML Screening
  - **Problem**: Over 90% of alerts are false positives
  - **Impact**: Massive review overhead during onboarding and transaction monitoring
  - **Solution**: Parcha's AI reduces false positives by 90%
  - **Coverage**: Adverse media, sanctions, watchlist, and PEP screening
