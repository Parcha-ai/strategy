  ## Q2 2025 GTM Failure Analysis
  
  ### Top of Funnel - Complete Failure
  - **Campaign**: 40 fintechs, 400 contacts via email/LinkedIn
  - **Result**: 0 demos booked
  - **Root Cause**: Messaging targeted Product/Eng, not Compliance
  
  ### Middle of Funnel - Engagement Collapse  
  - **Activity**: 50+ demos completed
  - **Result**: 0 new pilots started in Q2
  - **Follow-up Pattern**: 5-10 attempts with no response
  - **Root Cause**: No urgency, wrong stakeholders engaged
  
  ### Bottom of Funnel - Pilot Failures
  **IG**: Only success - closed due to clear urgency
  **Worldpay**: Multiple successful pilots but stuck in vendor diligence
  **Mercury/Synctera/Flex**: Pilots stalled due to internal priority shifts
  **Paxos**: Deal killed at contract by Compliance after pilot ($10K deal)
  
  ## Key Learning: Compliance Buy-in Timing
  
  ### The Fatal Flaw
  - We treated Product/Eng as champion/driver
  - We treated Compliance as approver
  - **Reality**: Compliance is the ECONOMIC BUYER
  
  ### Evidence
  - Coinbase: Requirements changed when Compliance finally engaged
  - Paxos: Compliance veto killed deal after successful pilot
  - MoneyGram: Only worked because we started with Chief Compliance Officer
  
  ## Three Root Causes Identified
  
  ### 1. Market Readiness
  - Hypothesis: "Lucky with early customers, most not ready for AI"
  - Counter-evidence: Greenlite at $10M CARR
  - Conclusion: Market exists but approach is wrong
  
  ### 2. Wrong Buyer Sequencing
  - Previous: Product → Pilot → Compliance approval
  - Needed: Compliance → Trust → Pilot → Expand
  
  ### 3. Low Priority
  - "Compliance efficiency not high priority vs growth"
  - Most concerning as largely out of our control
  - Requires reframing value proposition
  
  ## Competitive Intelligence Gap
  
  ### Greenlite Success Factors
  - Heavy investment in ACAMS presence
  - Constant PR and thought leadership
  - Compliance-first messaging
  - Trust signals everywhere
  
  ### Our Gaps
  - No compliance-focused content
  - No presence at compliance events
  - Product-centric messaging
  - Late compliance engagement
  
  ## Q3 Corrections
  
  1. **Compliance Trust Bundle** - GDPR, model governance, SOC 2
  2. **ACAMS Sponsorship** - Meet compliance where they gather
  3. **No Free Pilots** - $10K minimum shows seriousness
  4. **Compliance-First Outreach** - Target Chief Compliance Officers
  5. **Case Studies** - Build social proof for risk-averse buyers
