  ## LLM Cost Challenges
  
  ### Problem Evolution
  - **March 2024**: Negative margins on jobs due to GPT-4 Turbo usage
  - **April 2024**: $5K monthly OpenAI costs (up from $2.5K)
  - **May 2024**: Reduced to $3K through optimization
  
  ### Cost Optimization Strategies
  1. **Model Diversification**:
     - Switched high-volume workloads to Anthropic Haiku (24X cheaper)
     - Using Mistral for specific workloads
     - Testing open-source models
  
  2. **Infrastructure Optimization**:
     - Moved R&D to Azure/AWS (using $400K+ in credits)
     - Consolidated infrastructure to reduce hosting costs
  
  3. **Technical Improvements**:
     - Simplified workflows to use cost-effective LLMs
     - Prompt refinement and backtesting infrastructure
     - In-context learning techniques
  
  ## Production Incidents and Learnings
  
  ### Coinbase Production Issue
  - **Impact**: Had to fix issues after going live
  - **Root Causes**:
    - Insufficient production testing
    - Limited observability metrics
    - Less strict code review for customer branches
  - **Remediation**:
    - Mandatory 100-case validation period
    - Enhanced observability tooling
    - Stricter code review requirements
  
  ### Integration Challenges
  - **Pilot Delays**: Poor technical scoping caused 2-week delay
  - **Lesson**: Need better upfront technical discovery
  - **Customer Resource Constraints**: Multiple pilots stalled due to customer engineering resources
  
  ## Infrastructure and Scalability
  
  ### Document Processing
  - **Enhancement**: Multimodal models for validation
    - Logo verification on IRS letters
    - Seal and signature checking
    - Reduced reliance on Google OCR
  
  ### Prompt Management System
  - **Challenge**: Systematic improvement without regressions
  - **Solution**: AI-powered prompt optimization with large-scale testing
  - **Investment**: One-off contractor expense for system build
  
  ## Operational Efficiency Insights
  
  ### Human-in-the-Loop Economics
  - **Finding**: Not financially viable at $2/job pricing
  - **Root Cause**: 50% of analyst time spent on coordination
  - **Decision**: Focus on full automation vs. human augmentation
  
  ### Team Resource Management
  - **Challenge**: Stretched across too many use cases
  - **Impact**: Slower progress on core features
  - **Strategy**: Use pilot data to focus on highest-impact use cases
  
  ## Key Technical Metrics
  - **Customer Attested Accuracy**: >98%
  - **False Positive Reduction**: 90% for AML screening
  - **Processing Time**: Sub-1 minute for document APIs (target)
  - **Infrastructure Burn**: ~$278K/month (including higher headcount)
