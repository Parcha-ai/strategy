  ## Funnel Performance Breakdown
  
  ### Top of Funnel Failure
  - **Outbound Campaign**: 40 fintechs, 400 contacts
  - **Result**: 0 demos booked
  - **Response Rate**: ~0%
  - **Key Issue**: Complete lack of market response
  
  ### Middle of Funnel Issues
  - **Demos Completed**: 50+ in Q2
  - **Demo to Pilot Conversion**: 0 in quarter
  - **Historical Target**: 20-30% conversion
  - **Actual**: <2% conversion
  - **Follow-up Pattern**: 5-10 attempts with no response
  
  ### Bottom of Funnel Problems
  
  #### Pilot Outcomes
  1. **IG**: Successfully closed (only win)
     - Had clear need and urgency
     - Fast pilot execution
  
  2. **Worldpay**: Multiple successful pilots but stuck in vendor diligence
     - Lack of urgency despite success
  
  3. **Mercury, Synctera, Flex**: Pilots stalled
     - Internal priority changes
     - Resource constraints
  
  4. **Paxos**: Deal killed at contract stage
     - Compliance vetoed after pilot
     - Low deal size ($10K)
     - Multiple PM changes during pilot
  
  ## Root Cause Analysis
  
  ### 1. Market Readiness Hypothesis
  - **Theory**: "Lucky with early enterprise customers, but most compliance officers not ready for AI"
  - **Counter-evidence**: Greenlite rumored at $10M CARR
  - **Conclusion**: Market exists but approach is wrong
  
  ### 2. Buyer Engagement Timing
  - **Problem**: Compliance engaged too late in process
  - **Previous Approach**: 
    - Product/Eng as champion
    - Compliance as approver
  - **Reality**: Compliance is economic buyer
  - **Impact**: Deals killed at final stage
  
  ### 3. Priority Mismatch
  - **Finding**: "Compliance efficiency not high priority vs growth"
  - **Implication**: Must reframe value proposition
  - **Market Evidence**: Buyers exist but need different messaging
  
  ## Competitive Losses
  
  ### Direct Losses
  - **Cashfree**: Lost in pipeline
  - **Brex**: RFP outcome pending
  - **Multiple**: Lost to "legacy vendors"
  
  ### Win Analysis
  - **IG Bakeoff**: Won vs Greenlite
    - Parcha accuracy: 9/10
    - Greenlite accuracy: 4/10
    - Better product experience cited
  
  ## Sales Process Gaps Identified
  
  ### Discovery Issues
  - Insufficient pain qualification
  - Not understanding urgency drivers
  - Missing compliance stakeholder early
  
  ### Demo Problems
  - Too much demo, not enough discovery
  - Technical focus vs business impact
  - Self-serve friction too high
  
  ### Follow-up Failures
  - Lack of systematic engagement
  - No clear next steps defined
  - Champion development weak
  
  ## Strategic Response
  
  ### Immediate Changes
  1. **Stop Free Pilots**: $10K Assurance Pilot minimum
  2. **Compliance-First Engagement**: Trust bundle approach
  3. **Business Impact Messaging**: Less technical depth
  
  ### Channel Strategy Shift
  - Direct enterprise: High-trust approach
  - PLG motion: Fast-moving startups
  - Partner referrals: Leverage Alloy success
