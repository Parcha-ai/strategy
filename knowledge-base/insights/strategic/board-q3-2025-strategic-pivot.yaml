  ## Crisis Context
  
  ### Key Metrics (Q2 2025 Actuals vs Goals)
  - **ARR**: $987,803 (Goal: $2M) - MISSED by 50%
  - **Monthly Reviews**: 22,777 (Goal: 50K) - MISSED by 54%
  - **Paying Customers**: 7 (Goal: 20) - MISSED by 65%
  - **Burn Rate**: $234,742/month
  - **Runway**: 13 months (with flat growth → 9 months by Q3 end)
  
  ### Critical Problems Identified
  
  1. **Coinbase Concentration Risk**:
     - >50% of revenue from single customer
     - $1.5M expansion paused due to data breach priorities
     - Contract renewal risk in November
  
  2. **Sales Funnel Breakdown**:
     - Only 1 new deal closed in Q2 (IG) despite 50+ demos
     - Outbound campaign: 400 contacts → 0 demos
     - Demo to pilot conversion collapsed
  
  3. **Market Readiness Questions**:
     - "Compliance officers not ready to adopt AI"
     - Compliance viewed as low priority vs growth
     - Risk-averse buyers require high trust early
  
  ## Three-Part Strategic Pivot
  
  ### 1. GO DEEP on Trust (Enterprise)
  **Objective**: Rebuild compliance buyer confidence
  
  **Initiatives**:
  - Launch Compliance Trust Bundle (GDPR brief, model governance, SOC 2)
  - Book ACAMS Innovation Session + booth
  - Publish 3 compliance case studies
  - **Critical Change**: Stop free pilots → Require $10K "Assurance Pilot"
  
  **Target Impact**: +15-20K reviews/month
  
  ### 2. GO BROAD with Agent Hub (PLG)
  **Objective**: Test adjacent use cases for product-market fit
  
  **Rapid Experiments** (30-day gates):
  - Vendor Due Diligence (Aug 12)
  - Real Estate AML (Aug 26)
  - Investment Adviser Screening (Sep 9)
  
  **Success Gate**: ≥5 signups in 30 days per experiment
  **Q3 Target**: 30 activated workspaces → 5K reviews/month
  
  ### 3. BURN REDUCTION
  **Objective**: Extend runway to 15+ months
  
  **Actions**:
  - Cut burn from $250K → $175K/month
  - Don't backfill engineer ($16K/month)
  - Terminate Head of Revenue ($14.6K/month)
  - Cut founder salaries 25% ($10K/month)
  - Migrate to Northflank (50% COGS reduction = $32.5K/month)
  - Freeze all hiring
  
  **Total Savings**: $73.1K/month
  
  ## Agent Hub Early Success
  - **2 weeks post-launch**: 22 companies tried Parcha
  - More trials than total pilots in company history
  - Notable signups: Stablesea (Series A crypto), Veriff, UIPath
  
  ## Board Decisions & Guidance
  
  ### Key Discussion Points:
  1. **Dual-track Strategy**: Continue 3 Agent Hub experiments with ≤20% GTM bandwidth
  2. **PLG Gate Metrics**: ≥5 signups/30 days threshold confirmed
  3. **Trust Credentials**: Delay ISO 27001 until customer demand
  4. **Hiring Strategy**: "Hire less, pay more" + behavioral interviews
  
  ### Action Items:
  - AJ to connect with JPMC contact via Steve
  - PR team intro for Parcha 2.0 launch
  - Reframe messaging: business impact over technical depth
  - Use Paraform for design hire sourcing
  
  ## Competitive Intelligence
  - **Greenlite**: Rumored $10M CARR at Series A (May)
  - **Won**: IG bakeoff (9/10 accuracy vs Greenlite's 4/10)
  - **Lost**: Multiple deals to legacy vendors due to trust gap
