  ## Key Strategic Shifts from Board
  
  ### 1. Fundamental Messaging Pivot
  **From**: Enterprise-focused, compliance-heavy, platform messaging
  **To**: "AI Business Analyst" for individual users
  
  **Board Quote**: "Current approach too enterprise-focused, over-intellectualized"
  
  ### 2. Business Model Change
  - Target: $20/month SaaS model vs enterprise contracts
  - Focus: Individual analysts and operators
  - Distribution: Bottom-up adoption vs top-down enterprise sales
  - Pricing: Usage-based scaling from starter plans
  
  ### 3. Product Positioning as "AI Business Analyst"
  **Why This Works**:
  - More approachable than "AI compliance platform"
  - Speaks to the user (analyst) not the buyer (CISO)
  - Generalizable across use cases
  - Clear value prop: "An analyst that works for you"
  
  ### 4. Go-to-Market Strategy Overhaul
  **Distribution Focus**:
  - Meet users where they work: Slack, email, existing workflows
  - Email forwarding system for automatic entity analysis
  - Viral content strategy with demo videos per use case
  - Vertical-specific landing pages and templates
  
  **Key Insight**: "Avoid Coinbase-style custom integrations that drain resources"
  
  ### 5. Competitive Differentiation
  - **vs ChatGPT/Perplexity**: Proprietary data sources + deeper entity research
  - **vs E2B**: More opinionated, less technical setup required
  - **Market Signal**: GreenLight raising Series A validates compliance space
  
  ## Product Development Priorities
  
  ### Slack Integration Success
  - Claude-powered agents already handling:
    - Automatic signup analysis
    - Competitive intelligence  
    - Account management tasks
  - Maintains compliance requirements (audit trails, governance, PDFs)
  - Anthropic team showing strong interest
  
  ### Agent Hub Validation
  - More companies tried Parcha in 2 weeks than previous 6 months
  - Self-service onboarding now operational
  - Process reduced from 2 months to hours
  - Recent pilots using directly: Flagstone, MoneyGram, Sumsub
  
  ## Expansion Beyond Compliance
  Board consensus on platform capabilities extending to:
  - Vendor due diligence
  - Sales enrichment
  - Industry classification
  - Background checks
  - Startup qualification (Bridge request)
  
  ## Action Items from Board
  1. Develop simplified messaging around "AI Business Analyst"
  2. Create vertical-specific agent templates and landing pages
  3. Build email integration for seamless adoption
  4. Consider rebranding (Agent Factory concept mentioned)
  5. Implement PLG tactics: drip campaigns, vertical customization
  6. Test Slack integration with existing customers
  
  ## Critical Success Factors
  - Speed to value (minutes not months)
  - User-centric messaging (not buyer-centric)
  - Viral, shareable use cases
  - Bottoms-up adoption mechanics
  - Proprietary data advantage maintained
