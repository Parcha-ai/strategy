  ## Primary Competitor: Greenlite
  - **Status**: Becoming a significant competitor (May 2025)
  - **Market Presence**: Coming up in "a lot more deals than last year"
  - **Strategic Response**: Focus on launching self-serve product to accelerate time to value/revenue/integration
  
  ## Lost Deals Analysis
  
  ### Rho Account (June 2024)
  - **Lost To**: Accend
  - **Reason**: Competitor had better online due diligence solution
  - **Response**: Invested in new business due diligence report with:
    - Enhanced integrations
    - Improved data pipeline
    - Better AI and product experience
    - Social media scraping
    - Deeper web crawling
    - Additional sources (Crunchbase)
  
  ## Sales Conversion Challenges
  
  ### Pipeline Velocity Issues
  - Outbound, pilots, and closing contracts moving too slowly
  - Multiple "in progress" or "missed" goals due to pipeline delays
  
  ### Conversion Metrics
  - **Demo to Scoping**: Converting ~10% (target was 20-30%)
  - **POC to Paid**: Multiple challenges:
    - Long enterprise sales cycles (Coinbase: POC → Pilot → Production over months)
    - Customer priority shifts (Stripe)
    - Resource constraints on customer side
  
  ### Root Causes Identified
  1. **Insufficient Discovery**: Need more questions upfront, less demo'ing
  2. **Follow-up Process**: Not thorough enough with regular engagement
  3. **Self-serve Readiness**: Product requires too much customization pre-POC
  4. **Minimum ACV Requirements**: Need $50K-$100K potential to justify hands-on approach
  
  ## Strategic Adjustments Made
  
  ### Sales Process Improvements
  - Significantly ramped up outbound (target: 500 leads)
  - Better qualification criteria
  - Tighter sales process with defined outcomes per call
  - Outsourced sales support for process management
  
  ### Product Strategy
  - Building "Parcha 2.0" with self-serve onboarding
  - MVP demo'd at Finovate (60 leads generated)
  - Features: Agent builder flow, Stripe integration, KYC support
  - Target launch: June 2025
  
  ### Go-to-Market Focus
  - Narrowed target list to growth/enterprise fintechs
  - Strategic banks as secondary target
  - Account-based approach for enterprise deals
