# Strategy Memo: The Next Chapter - AI Due Diligence Agents
*Date: August 4, 2025*  
*Classification: Confidential*
*Author: Strategy Team*

## Executive Summary

Parcha stands at an inflection point. While our compliance-first approach has secured Coinbase as an anchor client, we must expand beyond single-customer concentration. This memo outlines our strategic evolution into AI Due Diligence Agents - specialized personas that deliver targeted intelligence where customers work.

Rather than abandoning our compliance heritage, we're expanding it. Due diligence encompasses compliance but extends to M&A, vendor risk, executive screening, and competitive intelligence. By personifying our AI capabilities as specialist agents and meeting users in Slack and email, we transform from a platform users must visit to intelligent colleagues working alongside them.

## Strategic Vision

**From**: Compliance platform users log into  
**To**: AI analysts working alongside users in their natural workflow

**The Next Chapter**: Deploy specialized AI agents that act as domain expert analysts, available instantly wherever due diligence decisions are made.

## The Agent Framework

### Core Agent Personas

We will develop six specialized agents, each with distinct expertise:

1. **Victoria Sterling** - M&A Due Diligence Specialist
   - Deep financial analysis, synergy identification
   - Target user: Corp dev teams, PE/VC analysts
   - 10 credits per analysis

2. **Marcus Kane** - Vendor Risk Analyst  
   - Security, compliance, operational stability
   - Target user: Procurement, IT security
   - 5 credits per assessment

3. **Elena Cross** - Executive Background Investigator
   - Career verification, reputation analysis
   - Target user: HR leaders, boards
   - 7 credits per investigation

4. **David Park** - Sales Intelligence Analyst

   - 5 credits per analysis

6. **James Chen** - International Compliance Specialist

   - Target user: Compliance, legal teams
   - 8 credits per screening

### Agent Design Principles

1. **Credible Backstories**: Each agent has professional experience that justifies their expertise
2. **Consistent Personality**: Distinct communication styles that remain consistent
3. **Domain Vocabulary**: Agents speak the language of their specialty
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Surface key findings first, details on request
5. **Collaborative Tone**: Agents work *with* users, not *for* them
